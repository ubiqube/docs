The configuration repository is used to store configuration files, which
can later be used in file-based configuration profiles or can be
directly attached to Devices.

==== Actions on the Repository Top Node

===== Add an Operator

image:images/Add_operator.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16] : adds an
operator to this repository

This action is only relevant for users that have an administrator role.

===== Get Information About the Repository

image:images/Help.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16] : displays the list of
profiles or devices that use files from this repository.

==== Actions on the Operator Nodes

As one or more operator(s) can be associated with a Configuration
repository, an operator can also be associated with a Customer or a
Manufacturer.

===== Add a Customer

image:images/Add_customer.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16] : the user can
select and add one or more customers from its managed customer list.

Adding a Customer acts as a filter: any file uploaded in a sub-folder of
a Customer will only be selectable for the associated Customer.

===== Add a Manufacturer

image:images/Add_manufacturer.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16] : the user
can select and add the managed device manufacturers.

Adding a Manufacturer acts as a filter: any file uploaded in a
sub-folder of a Manufacturer will only be available for the selected
Manufacturer.

==== Actions on the Customer Node

image:images/Add_manufacturer.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16] : the user
can select and add the managed device manufacturers.

Files uploaded to a sub-folder of a selected manufacturer will only be
available for the devices of that manufacturer (which are also attached
to the selected customer).

==== Adding/Removing Folders and Files

===== Adding/Removing Folders and Files

image:images/Add_directory.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16] : the user can
add a sub-folder to any of the following: Customer, Manufacturer or
folder.image:images/Action_delete.gif[Icon,width=14,height=16] : the
user can delete any of the following: Customer, Manufacturer, folder or
file.

The delete action is not available if the object is attached to a
template-based configuration profile or a device, or if the object is a
folder which contains a file attached to a template-based configuration
profile or a device.Hovering over
the image:images/Help.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16] icon displays the
list of profiles and devices that have a reference to any of the files
in the corresponding sub-tree.

===== Add Files

image:images/Add_upload_Configuration.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16] the
user can add a file to the selected folder.Via the dialog window, the
user can either upload a file from his file system
(image:images/Action_upload.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16] Import from
disk), or create a new file directly
(image:images/Modify.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16] Create new file).

Only text files can be uploaded in the configuration repository. Binary
file upload is not supported.

If the User chooses to create a new file (
image:images/Modify.gif[Icon,width=16,height=16]), they will be able to
create it via the edition window:

link:[image:images/image2018-4-5_16-55-33.png[Image,width=800]]

A File name, a Tag and a free text Comment can be given to the a file.

Depending on the repository selected (Workflow, Microservices,etc.), the
system will create the proper file.

NOTE: Don't forget to add the .xml extension to the name of the Workflow
when creating the file, otherwise the Workflow will not be available in
order to to be attached to a customer.

===== Add Files in Folder AutoAttached

The user can automatically attach a file to a device when the device is
created. This is useful when services have to be automatically
associated to devices.

In order to define the set of files (templates or microservices) to
associate to a device, the files must be uploaded under a folder that
goes by the name "AutoAttached". There is no dedicated action button to
create this folder, therefore it is up to the user to make sure that the
folder name and its location is correct.

The folder AutoAttached has to be created under a Model folder,
otherwise the files it contains will be ignored.

In the example below, every file found under AutoAttached will
automatically be attached to all newly created Fortinet/Generic.
