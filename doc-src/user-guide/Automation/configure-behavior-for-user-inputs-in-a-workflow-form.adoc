The main purpose for adding behaviour to a Workflow web form is to
address the use case in which the user form changes based on the value
of one (or more) variables called the selector.

In this case, the variable "Type" has 3 possible values, "subnet",
"FQDN" and "ip range". For each type, the web form show specific form
fields.

Where the type is "subnet":

Where the type is "FQDN":

Where the type is "ip range":

In order to implement this behaviour, we have to use the variable type
"Composite". This allows us to link the value of a variable to the
behaviour (visible or not, mandatory or not,...) of another variable.

The *first step* in creating this form is to produce a Workflow with all
the variables.

The variable $params.type must be a string with a default value and a
list of predefined values. It should be set as mandatory and adding free
values should not be allowed.

The *next step* is to configure each composite variable to define their
behaviour based on a selector variable.

For example, the variable $params.FQDN should be visible and mandatory
only if the value of $params.type is "FQDN".

In the section "Type" below, when the type is set to Composite, a
Selector variable field is available to choose which variable is going
to be used as the driver for selecting the behaviour of the other
variables.

The selector values will also have to be listed and for each value. The
advanced parameters (image:images/servers_view.gif[image,height=16])
should be edited to set the display name, the visibility, whether the
variable is mandatory or not, etc.

Once each of the composite variables are configured, the user web form
will behave as described.

It is also possible to link the behaviour of a variable to a selector
with a boolean type, as in the example below, where the variable
$params.abc (which is a composite) is hidden when the value of
$params.show_var_ABC is set to false, and shown when
$params.show_var_ABC is set to true.

The user form will look like this:
