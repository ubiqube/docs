In this tutorial you will learn how to use a Microservice to act as a
data provider for a Workflow variable.

The Microservice will be used to import the data with its IMPORT
function and the Workflow will use these values to build a dropdown
list.

This tutorial uses the Microservice *user.xml* that was built in this
link:../Configuration/Microservices/getting-started-developing-microservices.adoc[other
tutorial].

When using the Microservice on a Linux device, you can see the list of
users configured on the device.

On the workflow side, you need to declare 2 variables:

* a first variable with the type device. This variable will let you
select the device you want to use to run the IMPORT.
* another variable with the type "Microservice reference". In the
advanced parameter, Type, section of this variable you'll have to select
the microservice the device variable to use

== Microservice and Workflow Interaction

On the Microservice console, the users are listed, the column object_id
contains the user-names.

With the Workflow variable definition above, the variable will be
rendered as a list that contains the usernames from the Microservice.

We can do a simple test by adding a user directly on the Linux device

`                                     `

`[root@Demo17-1 ~]``# useradd aaa_test123`

`[root@Demo17-1 ~]``#`

Then execute the Workflow process "refresh user", the code is available
on github but below is the PHP code of the task. This task is calling a
PHP function synchronize_objects_and_verify_response to call the IMPORT
functions of the Microservices attached to the managed device

`                                     `

`<?php`

 

`function` `list_args()`

`{`

`}`

 

`$id` `= ``substr``(``$context``[``'device'``], 3);`

`$response` `= synchronize_objects_and_verify_response(``$id``);`

`$response` `= json_decode(``$response``, true);`

`if` `(``$response``[``'wo_status'``] !== ENDED) {`

`    ``$response`
`= prepare_json_response(FAILED, ``$response``[``'wo_comment'``], ``$context``, true);`

`    ``echo` `$response``;`

`    ``exit``;`

`}`

 

`task_success(``'Task OK'``);`

`task_error(``'Task FAILED'``);`

`?>`

Calling this function is equivalent to click on "Synchronize with
device" on the Microservice management console.

The workflow instance variable list is then updated with the new user
