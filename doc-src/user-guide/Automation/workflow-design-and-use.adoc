== Workflow, Workflow Instance, Process and Task 

To be able to execute a process, simple or complex, some entities need
to be created under the repository:

* *Workflow*: a Workflow or a Workflow definition file contains the
administrative information, processes and variables used. It is an XML
file stored in the repository.
* *Workflow Instance*: to actually use a Workflow, a process with the
type "create" has to be executed. Doing so will create a new instance
for the Workflow. Processes with type "update" or "delete" are available
to call on a Workflow instance.
* *Process*: a process is a series of tasks to execute. This is a simple
text files containing all ordering tasks.
* *Task*: a task is one action or step of a process. It is a PHP file.

NOTE: To help understand the concept, here is how Workflow could compare
to C++:

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Repositorystructure]]
== Repository structure 

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Servicefolder]]
=== Service folder 

All Workflows are listed under the Workflow folder in the repository. As
long as an entity (customer or operator) is able to view a Workflow
(based on its role) it can use a Workflow.

A user can define the visibility of a Workflow by putting it in specific
sub-tree.

If the Workflow is created in a folder at the root of the Workflow
repository, the Workflow will be visible by all. In the same way, the
Workflows' visibility can be restricted to customers or customers under
operator using repository icons.

Furthermore, the Workflows have to be attached to the customers in order
to be used.

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Workflowconsole]]
== Workflow console 

* The service console allows management of all the services from one
screen.
* The service console is available for the manager and customer. On the
legacy portal, the item "Manage Services" is under the General menu. On
the customer portal, this is a dedicated widget.

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Accesstotheconsole]]
=== Access to the console 

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Customerportal]]
==== Customer portal

On the customer portal, use the "SERVICES" tab to access to the
services.

link:[image:images/Servicespage3.png[Image,width=800]]

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Execution]]
=== Execution 

To execute a process, first select a Workflow or an instance of this
Workflow. If you select the service itself, only the create processes
will be available to use.

. Select the service of one instance of the service.
. Click on the process button.
. Fill variables for each tasks.
. Click "Run Now" to trigger new process execution.

link:[image:images/ServiceExecution1.png[Image,width=800]]

link:[image:images/ServiceExecution2.png[Image,width=800]]

The process is running now.

link:[image:images/ServiceTaskExecution.png[Image,width=800]]

Using the *Process Activity* tab, it is possible to monitor the
execution of the process and the current task. The execution starting
date and the elapsed time are also displayed. Note that the current
running task is displayed just below the corresponding process. The
*Service* and *Name* columns are left empty for tasks.

link:[image:images/ServiceTaskExecution1.png[Image,width=800]]

Once done, the status of the process executed become green.

link:[image:images/ServiceTaskExecuted.png[Image,width=800]]

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-SchedulingaProcess]]
=== Scheduling a Process 

Each process can be configured to allow scheduling independently.

link:[image:images/OrchestrationScheduling01.png[Image,width=800]]

When a process can be scheduled a new button ("Schedule") appears when a
process is launched.

link:[image:images/OrchestrationScheduling02.png[Image,width=800]]

link:[image:images/OrchestrationScheduling03.png[Image,width=800]]

When the process is scheduled, it is displayed in the *Process Activity*
tab.

link:[image:images/Servicespage3.png[Image,width=800]]

Note that if a *CREATE* process is scheduled later, the corresponding
service instance will only be created at the first execution of the
process, so the scheduling will only be visible in the *Process
Activity* tab, not in the *Services* tab before the first execution of
the process. Note also that only one service instance is created even if
the *CREATE* process is recurrent.

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-ProcessExecutionStatus]]
=== Process Execution Status 

To have the history of process execution, click the "Status" button when
a service is selected, or select one instance of the service. Each line
of the status window gives the user the status of the process (ended,
fail, warning or running), the start date, the end date and details. The
list of tasks execution can be accessed by clicking on the details icon
on the right.

link:[image:images/ServiceInstanceStatus2.png[Image,width=800]]

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Archiving]]
=== Archiving 

Each execution of a delete process moves the service instance to an
archived list. Then, the service instance is not longer visible from the
service tree instance. To list all services instances for a specific
service, first select a service and then click on the trash icon on the
right. A window appears and shows the last 20 service instances marked
as archived. For each instance, the last process executed is listed with
the status. Then, the user can:

* *Delete* a specific service instance by clicking on the trash icon.
* *Restore* a specific service instance. The instance will be displayed
on the initial service tree of the console.
* *Delete all* service instances for this service. All instances stored
into the database will be removed.

link:[image:images/ServiceInstanceArchived.png[Image,width=800]]

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Dashboard]]
=== Dashboard 

When you logged into the service management console, the first view is
the dashboard. The dashboard shows you 2 levels of information:

* *Service status*: This chart represents the repartition of processes
for each service. Each line represents a service and each color the
number of processes in the same states. Pass your mouse over the status
to have the exact number of processes in the same states. Click on the
status to open the status window filtered by the status clicked.

* *Last 10 processes*: This chart lists the last 10 processes executed
or in execution for all of the customer's services. The color of each
process points to the status of the process (running, ended, fail or
warning). A tool tip shows process information and displays the
associated service name, the start and end dates, the duration, and the
process ID. By clicking on the status, the users can have the detail of
execution of the process.

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Editors(CreateorUpdateaWorkflow)]]
=== Editors (Create or Update a Workflow) 

A Workflow can be edited by going to the service management page (first,
customer page, then tab "Workflow").

The creation of a Workflow has to be done directly in the Workflow
section of the repository: create a new file directly under Workflow or
in a sub-folder, and set its extension to XML (instead of the default
PHP).

The service editor provides a web-based graphical tool to create or
modify a service.

link:[image:images/Service_configuration.png[Image,width=800]]

 

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Serviceeditor]]
==== Service editor 

To open a service file, right click on it and click "Edit definition".

The following sections are available:

* *The PLUS Tab*: Create a new process.

* *INFORMATION* : Display administrative information for the service.
The user can:
** Select an *icon* from the library. This icon will be displayed in the
tree in the service console.
** Set a *display name*. This display name will be used in the service
console in the tree, in the dashboard, and as title for status windows.
** Set a *description* as a tooltip in the services tree in the console.
** Set a *category*. The category is a folder to sort services in the
console tree on the left. A hierarchy can be created by using "|"
between each folder name.
** Set a *service name variable*. The service name variable matches
"service_id" by default, otherwise one of the defined variables is used
as a name for each service instance created on the tree, to the right of
the status icon.
** Define the *rank in category*. Sorts local and global services on the
console tree.
** Select the *visibility of the service*. Depending to the user role, a
service can be displayed or not.

* *VARIABLES* : Shows variables or parameters used during process
execution. All variables are sent to a process during the execution.
** image:images/ServiceAddIcon.png[ServiceAddIcon.png,height=16] : Add a
new variable.
** image:images/ServiceDeleteIcon.png[ServiceDeleteIcon.png,height=16] :
Delete a variable after selection.
** image:images/ServiceVarUpIcon.png[ServiceVarUpIcon.png,height=16] :
Move up a variable. Drag and drop can be used to sort variable.
** image:images/ServiceVarDownIcon.png[ServiceVarDownIcon.png,height=16] :
Move down a variable. Drag and drop can be used to sort variable.
** image:images/ServiceVarPlayIcon.png[ServiceVarPlayIcon.png,height=16] :
Preview variable header displayed on the center of the console.
** image:images/ServiceVarExtractIcon.png[ServiceVarExtractIcon.png,height=16] :
Extract variable from process definition files.

* 'Variable customization':

link:[image:images/Variablecustomization.png[Image,width=800]]

Similarly to the OBMF/Microservice framework you can also configure
variable parameters:

* their visibility
* their type
* their order
* their display name
* their default value
* their access right (read only/read-write)
* their delegation level (administrator/customer)

* *PROCESS*: All tabs after the information and variable tabs are
processes. For each process, a user can define the type of the process
(CRUD), the display name and the level of visibility. A diagram shows
the order of task executions. You can change the order of the tasks by
using the drag and drop feature.
** Select the *type of the process* (CREATE, CREATE (if required), READ,
UPDATE, DELETE). Depending on the actions defined in your process, the
type permits you to manage the instance in the console. For example, if
you select the service ni the tree, only processes typed as CREATE will
be available. If you select an existing instance, you will have 
processes available to update or delete this specific instance. *Note*:
The *CREATE (if required) or update* is only useful for scheduling.
Thanks to this, you can create a service instance and update it using
only one process instead of using two different ones. In short, *the
create will become an update after being executed*.
** Set a *display name*.
** Set the *visibility*. Depending to the role of the user, this process
will be available or not. Associated status of for each instances of
this process will be filtered also.
** image:images/ServiceAddIcon.png[ServiceAddIcon.png,height=16] : Add a
new task as a step of the current process. A name should be provided
inside the blue box.
** image:images/ServiceBrowseIcon.png[ServiceBrowseIcon.png,height=16] :
Select a task from the repository.
** image:images/ServiceCreateIcon.png[ServiceCreateIcon.png,height=16] :
Create a new task file. The new task will be created under
Process/<Service_Name>/Tasks in the repository.
** image:images/ServiceEditIcon.png[ServiceEditIcon.png,height=16] :
Edit the task.
** image:images/ServiceDeleteIcon.png[ServiceDeleteIcon.png,height=16] :
Delete the task.

link:[image:images/ServiceEditor.png[Image,width=800]]

 

_On the screenshot below, there are 3 processes in "my VNF service":
Create VNF, Delete VNF and Update VNF_. My delete process is marked as
delete process. The display name is Delete VNF and the minimum role to
see the process is Administrator__.__

* *PROCESS popup design*: when a process is started MSA executes a set
of different PHP tasks. When designing the process you want to expose a
set of variables. For that purpose you must:
** declare and customize them in the variables tab (see below section)
** declare them in each PHP task they are requiredin.

A service can include further different processes and contain lot of
variables. For ergonomic reasons, a process popup will expose only
variables that will be declared in both the service variables list and
PHP tasks.

link:[image:images/Variabletaskdeclaration.png[Image,width=800]]

 

*Example*: Here is a service that includes about 10 variables
(username/device/password/role/...). All of them will be exposed when
triggering the creation process.

link:[image:images/Createpopup.png[Image,width=800]]

Only the username will be displayed when executing the retry process.
See popup in screenshot:

[[WorkflowDesignandUse-Authorization]]
==== Authorization 

The service orchestration provides a simple service authorization
mechanism applicable independently to each service’s process, based on
the connected user role.

It is therefore possible, for a given service to give an execution
authorization to a simple manager (or above), and for another process of
the same service to give the execution authorization to a privileged
manager (or above).
