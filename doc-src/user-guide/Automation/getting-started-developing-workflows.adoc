== Overview

This tutorial walks you through the design and development of your first
workflow.

Workflows can be used to automate a wide variety of task and processes,
such as:

* Service configuration chaining
* VNF lifecycle management
* Configuration audit and verification
* Automated Customer on-boarding

== The "Helloworld" Workflow

As an example, we'll use the "Helloworld" workflow. The "Helloworld"
workflow will print a name as IN parameter and will display a message to
the user ("Hello NAME").

This workflow is composed of 3 processes: one to create the new instance
of the workflow, one to enter the name and print it, and on to delete
the instance.

=== Create a New Workflow

From the workflow repository, select the folder "Helloworld" and create
a new workflow:

Note: If there is no "Helloworld" folder, you will need to create one.
See link:../Repository%20Management/repository-management.adoc[Repository
Management] for instruction on how to create a folder.

In the "INFORMATION" tab, leave all settings as default:

Create a "Variable Name" in the "VARIABLES" tab:

Save your workflow and attach it to your customer (customer page, tab
"SERVICE", sub-tab "Workflows", click on the green "+" icon on the left
and select "Helloworld" workflow from the repository).

=== Create the Processes

==== "create instance" Process

In order to be used, every workflow should be instantiated first. This
is the role of the process with the type "Create".

Note: even though for most use cases, one "Create" process is
sufficient, it is possible to have several "Create" processes to handle
one or more ways of creating the workflow instance.

For this tutorial you will create one process named "create instance"
and add one task to this process. This task will simply display a
message to the process execution console.

``

`<?php`

`/**`

` ``* This file is necessary to include to use all the in-built libraries of /opt/fmc_repository/Reference/Common`

` ``*/`

`require_once`
`'/opt/fmc_repository/Process/Reference/Common/common.php'``;`

`/**`

` ``*/`

`function` `list_args() { }`

`/**`

` ``* End of the task do not modify after this point`

` ``*/`

`task_exit(ENDED, ``"workflow initialised"``);`

`?>`

Once done, save the workflow.

Find a green "+" icon with the label "create instance" beside it. Click
on the icon and then "Run now", the process will execute and a new
workflow instance is created.

== The "delete instance" Process

Follow the same steps as in the "create instance" process, but make sure
that the type of the process is set to "Delete", instead of "Create".

When complete, your workflow console should look like this:

== The "print message" Process

For the print process, use the process type "Update". It will take one
parameter that will be used to print your message. Use the code below to
create a task that will read the name from the user form and print it in
the live console.

`/**`

` ``* get the value of name from the context and create a variable out of it`

` ``*/`

`$name``=``$context``[``'name'``];`

`/**`

` ``* print the value in the log file /opt/jboss/latest/log/process.log `

`logToFile(``$name``);`

 

`/**`

`task_exit(ENDED, ``"Hello "` `. ``$name``);`

 

`?>`

Execute this process and watch the result on the console. It should look
similar to what's shown below (except with your name).
