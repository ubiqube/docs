If a Workflow needs to be invoked from a portal and REST API in the
command line, the Workflow needs to include extra code.

The reason for this is because when you invoke the Workflow from UI
Portal, all the parameters go into the $context, but when you invoke the
Workflow from the command line using REST APIs, all the input parameters
go into the $parameters. 

The Workflow engine only considers the parameters set in $context.
Therefore, all the parameters provided on the command line will go into
$parameters and will not be considered for the execution. Instead,
previously saved parameters will be used. 

In order to ensure that a Workflow can be executed from both the UI and
the command line, it should have some code which will copy the
parameters from $patameters to $context. The code is as follows:

....

if(isset($parameters) ){
    $context['<param_name_1>'] = $parameters['<param_name_1>'];
    $context['<param_name_2>'] = $parameters['<param_name_2>'];
   ......
   ....
 }
....
