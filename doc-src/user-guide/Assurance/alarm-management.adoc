[[AlarmManagement-Overview]]
== Overview

The alarm management module is based on the detection of events which
internal (VNOC), SNMP thresholds, or sylogs sent by the managed devices
and collected by the MSActivator. Alarm management is designed to
provide email notifications to customers or managers, to send SNMP traps
to an external trap server, or trigger predetermined automated
processes.

The detection of events relies on rules configured at the super
administrator level. Rule management is available for the super
administrator (ncroot). The rules are defined globally and can be
modified by the SOC team. The SOC team can modify the setting of the
notification on a per-event and/or per-customer basis. The rules are
executed on a periodic basis (the period frequency can be configured)
and alarms are generated whenever a rule matches.

[[AlarmManagement-RuleManagement]]
== Rule Management 

Rule management allows the super administrator to build, test and
configure some rules.

[[AlarmManagement-EventDetails]]
=== Event Details 

The event row can be expanded to display all the event fields as well as
some additional fields.

[[AlarmManagement-Eventfields]]
==== Event fields 

[[AlarmManagement-Internalevents]]
===== Internal events 

The event below is an internal event (prefixed by VNOC) generated by the
MSActivator.

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_VNOC_event_detail.png[Image,width=800]]

* _timestamp: this is the date when the event was actually stored in the
MSActivator log indexer.
* _ttl: this is the event Time To Leave in the log indexer cluster. "2w"
stands for 2 weeks. This means that after 2 weeks this event will be
removed from the system. This value is configurable systemwide and it
should be set according to the event and logs retention period required
for the MSActivator.

[[AlarmManagement-Syslog]]
===== Syslog 

Alarms can also be triggered based on conditions that match certain
syslogs sent by devices.

For example, the event below is triggered by a FortiGate when login
attempts fail three times in a row:

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_syslog_event_detail.png[Image,width=800]]

[[AlarmManagement-Matchingrules]]
==== Matching rules 

When lots of rules are stored in the system, it is convenient to be able
to get the list of the rules that match a specific event. The list of
matching rules is available in the "matching rule(s)" tab of the event
detail.

In the example below, you can see that the first result of the search
for "Header Leakage*" would also be matched by the rule RESERVED.

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_matching_rules.png[Image,width=800]]

The reason for this is the term "RESERVED" is also found in the first
result of the search for "Header Leakage*", which houses the rule
"RESERVED".

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_matching_rules_2.png[Image,width=800]]

[[AlarmManagement-RuleBuilder]]
=== Rule Builder 

The rule builder field is a simple textbox that allows the user to type
rules based on the MSActivator search engine query syntax.

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_ruleBuilder.png[Image,width=800]]

The rule is directly executed over the events that are available in the
system.

[[AlarmManagement-Severity]]
==== Severity 

You can select from a list of severities to associate to a rule.

A severity selection is required when building a rule. Selecting a
severity will allow, for example, the system to raise an alarm whenever
a certain severity is raised, whatever the event is.

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_sel_severity.png[Image,height=173]]

[[AlarmManagement-ScopeofaRule]]
==== Scope of a Rule

By default, a rule will apply to all customers on the system, and thus
by extension, to every device in the system.

It is possible to create rules on a customer by customer basis. When
creating customer specific rules, only one customer can be selected at a
time.

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_sel_customer.png[Image]]

[[AlarmManagement-RuleCriteria]]
==== Rule Criteria 

Two types of criteria are available for configuration:

* the alarm recipient
* the alarm media

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_rulemngt.png[Image]]

The alarm recipient is a list of checkboxes (customer, manager,
privileged manager and administrator). It is mandatory to select at
least one recipient for the rule. Each recipient is associated to a role
as defined by the MSActivator
https://training.ubiqube.com/16.2/wikiTraining/index.php/Lab_Setup_%28Portal%29_Concepts[RBAC].
This selection determines who will be contacted when an alarm is
triggered. An alarm can also be sent to a group of users based on the
roles selected by the alarm recipient check-boxes.

[[AlarmManagement-AutomatedProcessExecution]]
==== Automated Process Execution 

In addition to notifications, the user can configure the execution of a
Workflow process when an alarm occurs.

link:[image:images/Activate_automated_process_execution.png[Image,width=800]]

To do this, select a service and a process using the list shown above.

From the advanced parameter section, select the fields that will be
passed as parameters to the process.

The list of fields should match the list of variables that are defined
for the process.

For example, the following process variables:

link:[image:images/Process_variable_example.png[Image,width=800]]

would be listed as:

link:[image:images/Process_alarm_variable_example.png[Image,width=800]]

*Note:* the parameters are used to run an aggregation query over the
data index in the Elasticsearch cluster. Therefore it is not recommended
to use the date or raw log fields as process parameters, because the
value of these fields is different for each log.

[[AlarmManagement-EventCumulationandCumulationTime]]
===== Event Cumulation and Cumulation Time

When processes need to be executed based on events, there is a
possibility to control the event cumulation. This is to avoid cases
where lots of events are triggered (some security attack for example)
but we don't want the system to execute 1 process per event.

By default the event cumulation (EC) is set to 10: ten events will have
to be detected before the process is executed.

The default cumulation time is 15 minutes: the system will wait 15
minutes to trigger the process.

This event cumulation time (ET) defines a sliding window of ET minutes.
A workflow is triggered when at least EC events have been detected in
the sliding window of ET minutes.Setting 0 to ET means an empty sliding
window and no alarm can be found (this of course should be avoided).

The two parameters work together and whichever threshold is reached
first will trigger the execution.

link:[image:images/image2019-3-1_15-40-11.png[Image,width=300]]

Setting the event cumulation (EC) to 0 means "real-time mode". This
leads to:

* have the fastest response time,
* ensure that there is one workflow executed for one event matching the
detection rule.

If EC is different from 0, a filter aggregates in one event the events
detected at the same time for the same customer and the same device.

[[AlarmManagement-RuleCreation]]
==== Rule Creation 

To be applied, the rule must be saved in the system.

For example, in order to get notifications whenever login to the device
fails due to an invalid password on a managed device, the rule below can
be used and saved with a name (in this case, "LOGIN_FAILED"):

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_save_alarm_login_failed.png[Image,width=800]]

[[AlarmManagement-RuleLoadandUpdate]]
==== Rule Load and Update 

To update an existing rule, the rule should be loaded first.

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_load_rule.png[Image]]

Then click "save rule".

[[AlarmManagement-RuleDeletion]]
==== Rule Deletion 

To delete a rule, simply click on the red "X" and confirm the action
when prompted.

[[AlarmManagement-RuleApplication]]
==== Rule Application 

A rule is applicable as soon as it is saved in the system.

If a rule has been created to send a email if a match is found, the
system will start running the rule and possibly sending emails as soon
as the rule is saved.

The MSActivator rule matching process is a rule with a period (in
seconds) that can be configured with the configuration tool, accessed
using the following path:

....
SEC Engine configuration->Initial Configuration->check_alert period
....

For more details read the _Technical details_ chapter.

[[AlarmManagement-AlarmManagement]]
== Alarm Management 

Users can view their alarms from the customer portal or from the
customer menu (Monitoring->Alarm)

link:[image:images/Alarm_aggAndDetailsView.png[Image,width=800]]

The user can select the time range they wish to display (from the last
10 minutes to the past day). Users can also select the number of events
to be displayed in the detailed view. The alarm summary view shows a
list of events aggregated by severity, type and subtype. The detail view
shows each event with the detail of the event that triggered the alarm.

[[AlarmManagement-Examples]]
== Examples 

[[AlarmManagement-CreateaRuletoSendAlarmforSNMPThresholds]]
=== Create a Rule to Send Alarm for SNMP Thresholds 

SNMP thresholds can be configured using monitoring profiles. The SNMP
threshold events are characterized by the keyword *SNMPTHLD*. The
following search should bring back some results, provided that this kind
of event has been raised and exists in the event index.

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_SNMP_THRESHOLD_rule.png[Image,width=800]]

[[AlarmManagement-CreateRulestoSendAlarmforConfigurationUpdate]]
=== Create Rules to Send Alarm for Configuration Update 

Configuration update events are generated by the MSActivator and look
like this:

....
%VNOC-<severity level>-UPDATECONF: <message>
....

The following rule should match every configuration update related
event, whether it failed or it succeded:

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_UPDATECONF_OK.png[Image,width=800]]

Or for configurations related to object:

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_PUSHCONFIG.png[Image,width=800]]

In case of a configuration error, the MSActivator will raise an
event %VNOC with a severity level 1 (%VNOC-1-UPDATECONF: <message>)

One possible way to detect PUSHCONFIG events that have failed is to
filter the event by severity and only search for severity 1:

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_PUSHCONFIG_failed.png[Image,width=800]]

Another method to generate an alarm based on configuration failure is:

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_UPDATECONF_FAILED.png[Image,width=800]]

It is often useful to have multiple rule types for different types of
configuration related events.

For example, license related issues can be detected by the rule below:

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_UPDATECONF_LICENSE_FAILED.png[Image,width=800]]

[[AlarmManagement-CreateRulestoSendAlarmWhenDeviceGoesDownorUp]]
=== Create Rules to Send Alarm When Device Goes Down or Up 

To trigger an alarm when an IPUP or an IPDOWN happens, use the rule
below:

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_IPUPDOWN.png[Image,width=800]]

[[AlarmManagement-CreateaRuletoDetectSecurityEvents]]
=== Create a Rule to Detect Security Events 

Use the rule below to detect threat events detected by a UTM:

link:[image:images/Alarm_management_type_threat.png[Image,width=800]]

This rule can be made more specific to target specific threats. As shown
below, you can use it to detect a threat were the destination port is
80:
