[#conf_variables]
== Managed entities configuration variables

Configuration variables can be associated to any managed entity in order to add custom configuration.

In order to managed these configuration variables, you can use the workflow link:https://github.com/openmsa/Workflows/tree/master/Utils/Manage_Device_Conf_Variables[Manage Device Variables].

The workflow provices a simple UI to create/update/delete and list the configuation variables associated to a managed entity.

To use it, first you need to associate it to your subtenant then execute the process *Init* to select a managed entity. *Init* will also read the database for any existing configuration variable.

Once created, you can use the workflow instance to manage the configuration variables.

IMPORTANT: If you use the process *Delete*, the workflow instance will be deleted but it *will not* delete the configuration variables

The workflow instance is identified by it's ID associated to the managed entity ID (ex: `Instance: 49 / ME: BLR160` in the screenshot above)
