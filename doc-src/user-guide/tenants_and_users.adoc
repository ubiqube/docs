The {product_name} platform provides a multi-roles and multi-tenancy hierarchy that should accommodate all your specifics requirement.

== Overview

Tenant and user management screens are available in the "Admin" section of the {product_name} UI.

== Initial connection

The {product_name} comes with one pre-created super admin user: ncroot (the equivalent of the root user on Linux systems). The default password for this user is "ubiqube".

This default password should be changed, especially if the {product_name} is meant to be used in a production environment.

== Overview

The {product_name} has 2 levels of tenancy: tenant and subtenant. 

These 2 levels will let you organize your managed entities based on your need will ensuring that access restriction based on the user role is fully respected.

4 user roles are available to make sure that you can assign the access and managing roles to your users based on their actual roles in your company.

== Tenancy management

The {product_name} is designed to provide multi-tenancy. A tenant is a virtual private space that can be managed as an isolated environment.

There are two levels of tenancy, tenant and subtenant, the latter being nested in the first one.

Tenancy management is provided on the UI in the "Admin" section on the left menu.

=== Tenant

Select the "Tenants" section in the "Admin" menu and click on the "+ Create Tenant" button to create a new tenant.

The "Tenant Prefix" is a three letters, unique identifier for the tenant. It will be combined with the subtenant or the managed database identifier to build a short, comprehensive, unique identifier that you can use to filter application logs when troubleshooting or when you need to communicate with the support team.

=== Subtenant

Select the "Subtenants" section in the "Admin" menu and click on the "+ Create Subtenant" button to create a new subtenant.

Carefully select the tenant where the subtenant will be created as moving a subtenant to another tenant is not possible without database update.

== User management

Four types of users are available:

    - ncroot, the privileged administrator
    - the administrator users
    - the privileged manager users
    - the manager users

=== Privileged administrator (ncroot)

ncroot is the only predefined user within the {product_name}. It's the user with the highest level of privilege. 

In addition to the action available to the other users with lower privileges, ncroot can create the tenants, upload and activate the {product_name} product licenses, create administrator users.

=== Administrator

Administrator users can only be managed by ncroot.

Administrators are associated with one or more tenants and have full access rights over these tenants.

A typical administrator job is to create the managers and privileged manager as well as the subtenant within its tenants.

=== Privileged manager and manager

Privileged managers are restricted to a single tenant.

Within their tenant, privileged managers have full access rights and can perform tasks such as subtenant management, device management, user and rights management.

Managers are restricted to a single tenant and, within this tenant, to a subset of subtenants.

By default, the managers have restricted, read-only access to the subtenant.

A manager may be used to provide self-care access to the {product_name} portal.

== Audit record

The audit logs record every call to the {product_name} API, this includes user action on the UI and direct call to the REST API

.Example
----
    John logged in.
    John opened the Management dashboard.
    John applied sub-tenant filter "Hoth".
    John listed the workflows attached the to sub-tenant "Hoth".
    John executed the workflow "Create ME" on the sub-tenant "Hoth".
    ....
    John logged out.
---- 

The audit logs are available for each user in the "Profile" menu, under "Audit Logs".

=== Roles and rights management : permission profiles

The {product_name} provides a simple authorization mechanism based on 4 user roles, the privileged administrator, the administrator, the privileged manager, and the manager.

By default, managers have a very restricted access to the data. They can only view the information of the subtenant and managed entities they are entitled to. In order to grant more rights to a manager, it is possible to use a permission profile.

A permission profile is an aggregation of rights such as "create a device", "activate a device", "configure a device",... that are turned on or off depending on your user management policy. This profile is applied to a set of one or more users.

you can create a permission profile

NOTE: Permission profiles are a key feature for configuring and providing self-care management to an end-user.
