== Overview

By clicking on any device from the device list, you will be directed to
the device overview page.

Besides showing the name and status of the device, it also provides more
detailed information like the serial number and the firmware the device
is running on.

Basic details of the device, like the device name and IP address, can be
edited with the edit tool and the device can also be removed here.

Click on the “Attach Files” button to add configurations (Microservices
and/or templates) to the device.

Examples of these are templates for the initial device configuration,
files to update a specific configuration, or even Microservices to
enable a Day-2 configuration of an existing device setup.

Firmware images can also be attached to automate image upgrades.
