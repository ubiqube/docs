It is possible to support a fall-back mechanism based on TFTP and Telnet
when secure connection fails or is not supported by the device (see

[[DeviceLifecycle-Monitoring]]
== Monitoring

[[DeviceLifecycle-DeviceStatus]]
=== Device Status

MSA monitoring engine checks for ICMP reachability every minute. The
status of a managed entity is graphically represented by 4 colours:
blue, green, yellow and red and displayed on the user portal

link:[image:images/image2019-11-13_14-34-23.png[Image,width=800,height=59]]

NOT ACTIVE :  the managed entity is created in the MSActivator database
but not yet activated with initial provisioning. The MSActivator is not
monitoring or managing this device yet

NOTE: once a managed entity is created it's immediately accounted for
the MSActivator product license even if it's not activated

UP : the managed entity  was activated and is currently monitored using
ICMP

CRITICAL : the managed entity  is monitored and at least one ICMP
request failed but at most 5 ICMP requests failed

DOWN : There was 5 ICMP request failures in a row and the 6th one failed

[[DeviceLifecycle-IPUP/IPDOWNevents]]
==== IPUP/IPDOWN events

When a device status changes, the MSActivator will generate some
internal events that can be used to configure some alarms.

[[DeviceLifecycle-Rulesforstatuschange]]
===== Rules for status change

When the status changes from UP or CRITICAL to DOWN, an event IPDOWN is
generated.

When the status changes from DOWN to UP, an event IPUP is generated.

If a device is DOWN but a syslog is collected and detected to be coming
from the device, an IPUP will be generated but the status will stay
DOWN.

These events will be stored in the Elasticsearch cluster and will be
available for alarm management just like a regular syslog.

[[DeviceLifecycle-MonitoringProfile]]
=== Monitoring Profile

The link:../Assurance/monitoring-profile.adoc[monitoring profiles] are
based on SNMP request to get the KPI values from the managed entities.

When a monitoring profile is associated to a managed entity, the
MSActivator monitoring engine (polld) will start polling for the KPI by
sending an SNMP request to the managed entity and storing the result in
a dedicated database.

If the SNMP request fails, by default, no action will be taken,
monitoring data will not be recorded and the graph will show an empty
gray bar.

[[DeviceLifecycle-AssetManagement]]
=== Asset Management

The asset management module is in charge of maintaining the device
link:../Managed%20Devices%20and%20Entities/device-history.adoc[asset
history] up to date.

The implementation of the asset management is vendor specific and
therefore implemented in the adapter in a PHP script located in
/opt/sms/bin/php/polld/ named <DA Model>_mgmt.php.

When the managed entity  is activated, this script will be executed and
is in charge of getting assets information about the managed entity such
as it's firmware version, serial number, memory,...

To get this information the MSActivator will connect to the managed
entity  and read the information. Usually this is done with REST API or
SSH/CLI, depending on the managed entity  capabilities.

The asset management task is scheduled to run once a day for every
managed device.

It is possible to force the refresh of the asset with the SecEngine
command FORCEASSET.

on a Fortigate firewall, the asset management daemon (polld) will
connect on the device with SSH, use some CLI command to get the required
info and store the information in the database

[[DeviceLifecycle-LogAnalytic]]
=== Log Analytic

The link:../Assurance/log-analysis.adoc[log analytic] module is part of
MSActivator assurance. The MSActivator can collect syslogs sent from a
managed entity.

The syslogs are collected by the SecEngine syslog collector (syslogd) on
UDP/514

[[DeviceLifecycle-ConfigurationManagement]]
== Configuration Management

[[DeviceLifecycle-InitialProvisioning]]
=== Initial Provisioning

In order to activate a managed entity, the initial provisioning is a
mandatory step.

The initial provisioning is a multiple steps process where the
MSActivator configuration engine will try to connect on the managed
entity, push an optional initial configuration and backup the running
configuration in it's configuration change management database.

It is possible to trigger the
link:../Getting%20Started/managed-devices.adoc[initial provisioning]
with the API or the UI.

[[DeviceLifecycle-ConfigurationTemplates]]
=== Configuration Templates

link:/documentation/configuration-template/[Configuration Templates] can
be used to update a device configuration.

By default, template based configuration has to be triggered manually
(with the UI or API) but it is possible to configure a managed entity to
activate the automated configuration update.

If the automated configuration update is activated, any configuration
related change on the managed device attributes (host name, management
interface,... or any configuration variable) will trigger a
configuration update.

link:[image:images/image2019-11-14_11-43-14.png[Image,width=800]]

[[DeviceLifecycle-Microservices]]
=== Microservices

link:/documentation/microservices/[Microservice] can be designed to read
and import a managed entity  configuration items or to create/update a
managed entity  configuration item.

[[DeviceLifecycle-ConfigurationChangeManagement]]
=== Configuration Change Management

[[DeviceLifecycle-Backup]]
==== Backup

The
link:../Managed%20Devices%20and%20Entities/device-history.adoc[configuration
change management module] will backup the running configuration of a
managed entity each time the configuration is changed either by an
initial provisioning or a configuration update.

The module will also execute a daily backup of the configuration of all
the managed entities registered and activated in the MSActivator. This
is to ensure that manual configuration are also backed up and detected
(it is possible to configure an alarm to get notified when a manual
configuration occurs).

The backup process is implemented in the device adapter.

[[DeviceLifecycle-Rollback]]
==== Rollback

The configuration change management module can also be used to rollback
a managed entity configuration to a previous configuration. The
MSActivator will use the selected configuration to replace the device
running configuration. The rollback process is implemented in the device
adapter.

[[DeviceLifecycle-AdditionalConsiderations]]
== Additional Considerations

It is possible to use non-secure protocol such as TFTP or Telnet to
manage devices.

This is as per implemented in the device adapter and it is a design
choice to use these protocol for device management.

In most cases, these protocols are used as a fall back mechanism when
the use of the default secure protocol fails. For instance, some device
are initially configure to support Telnet only and the initial
provisioning can use Telnet to activate SSH.

When TFTP is used, the connection is always initiated by the device
toward the MSA. The initiation of the connection is done by sending some
CLI commands (or call some REST API) on the device.
