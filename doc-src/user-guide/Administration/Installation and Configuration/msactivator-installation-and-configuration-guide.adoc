== Installation

=== Getting the image

The MSActivator is a server platform that runs on CentOS Linux. It is
available as a .ova or .QCOW2 image (size is around 3 GB).

Download the .ova image of the MSActivator server from the repository
and save it.

The root password for the .ova is: $ubiqube.

=== Interface Configuration

Sometimes interfaces eth0 and eth1 are not visible. If this is the case,
you need to edit the interface configuration file:

....
[root@MSActivator]#cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
[root@MSActivator network-scripts]#vi ifcfg-eth0
....

Remove the reference to UUID and HWADDR. The file should be as shown:

....
DEVICE="eth0"
BOOTPROTO="none"
IPV6INIT="yes"
IPV6_AUTOCONF="yes"
NM_CONTROLLED="yes"
ONBOOT="yes"
TYPE="Ethernet"
IPADDR=10.31.1.14
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=10.31.1.254
....

Do the same process with ifcfg-eth1

Then activate interfaces:

....
[root@MSActivator network-scripts]# ifup ifcfg-eth0
[root@MSActivator network-scripts]# ifup ifcfg-eth1
....

If an error occurs, perform the following:

....
[root@MSActivator]# echo "" > /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
[root@MSActivator]#reboot
....

=== Configuration

Once the OVA is installed, start the VM. You should see the MSActivator
services starting messages in the console. Make sure that the network
setup of the VM, as well as the other parameters such as CPU, Disk,
etc., are setup correctly. The MSActivator deploys with 50GB disk, but
you may extend this to allow for more flexibility later on.

Connect as root to the MSActivator.

The following steps explain how to configure the network interface eth0
in order to be able to use the online configuration tool:

Configure eth0 with an address from your network:

link:[image:images/image2018-7-19_10-34-16.png[Image,height=36]]

Try to access http://ip_configured:3577/config.xml (login:socconfig,
password:b5ty9uvh4).

Once successful, follow the instructions for the online configuration
tool below.

=== Online Configuration Tool

This is the configuration method for the MSActivator freeware
access: http://w.x.y.z:3577/config.xml(login:socconfig,
password:b5ty9uvh4). Access is only available through eth0 (maintenance
interface).

* eth0 is the interface dedicated to maintenance
* eth1 is the interface dedicated to device management

Fill out the sections shown below as appropriate.

===== Alarm and Event Configuration

link:[image:images/image2018-7-19_10-36-42.png[Image,width=800]]

===== Run the Configuration

Choose the option to "apply configuration and reboot". The configuration
will take 5-10 minutes, depending on the resources (CPU/Mem) allocated
to the MSActivator.

The configuration will start, and your browser will show this message
until the configuration ends:

link:[image:images/config_apply.jpg[Image,width=800]]

After a while, when the configuration is finished, a new message will be
displayed, and the CentOS guest virtual machine will reboot.

link:[image:images/config_dialog.jpg[Image,width=800]]

You can now close this page on the web browser.

Once the CentOS finished booting, MSActivator is available and ready to
use.

===== First login

To check that your MSActivator server is up and running, connect to the
IP address configured for eth1 of the CentOS guest virtual machine with
a web browser.

Example: http://192.168.13.203/

By default, you will see the legacy portal.

link:[image:images/BSS.jpg[Image,width=800]]

Change the "BSS" in the URL to "UBI" in order to connect the new portal.

link:[image:images/UBI.jpg[Image,width=800]]

Now, you can login as _ncroot_ with the default password__ ubiqube__

This is the MSActivator interface that you will get at the beginning.
Note that the list of devices is empty because no device has been
created in MSActivator yet.

This is the end of the installation procedure.

== Activation

=== Install the License File

You must be connected as a privileged administrator (ncroot) on the new
portal to install the license.

As a privileged administrator, click on the MSActivator setting icon at
the top of the screen.

This will access the system management UI where the license management
is

link:[image:images/image2018-7-19_10-37-3.png[Image,width=800]]

Click on "Upload" and select your file.

Once uploaded, and before proceeding, the MSActivator will show you the
certificate information (i.e. number of devices manageable and end of
support time). Verify this information is correct before clicking apply.
If this information is not correct, or you wish to change it, contact
UBiqube support.

This is an example of the "apply" dialog box:

link:[image:images/image2018-7-19_10-37-18.png[Image]]

The updated UI should show the actual license information.

== Troubleshooting

=== Problem with keyboard input to the command-line interface

It is very likely that the keyboard layout of your host computer and the
CentOS guest are different. As a result, special characters like # or $
and others are difficult to find when typing into the CentOS
command-line interface.

In order to bypass this issue, you can connect to CentOS via SSH with
the SSH client of your choice. Connect as root with $ubiqube as a
password.

Example with PuTTY under windows 10:

First, launch PuTTY, keep all the settings at their default value, and
just enter the CentOS guest IP address, and click "Open".

link:[image:images/putty_1.jpg[Image,width=400]]

Then, at the "login as" prompt, enter _root_

Enter _$ubiqube_ when prompted for the password

link:[image:images/putty_ssh.jpg[Image,width=400]]

Once connected via SSH, you can use all your usual keyboard keys to
input characters.

=== Case of Windows 10

Windows 10 supports an integrated Hyper-V virtualization system. If this
system is activated, some hypervisors like VirtualBox may be able to
launch but not to run virtual machines.

If you get an error message when trying to launch the MSActivator image,
you need to de-activate the Hyper-V support.

Example of error messages with VirtualBox:

link:[image:images/Hyper-V%20error_1.jpg[Image,width=800]]

First, launch a command prompt as an Administrator by a right-click on
the command prompt entry in the windows menu and selection of "Run as
administrator".

link:[image:images/Admin-command-prompt.jpg[Image,width=400]]

Then, enter the following command to disable Microsoft Hyper-V

....
C:\windows\system32>dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V
....

link:[image:images/Hyper-V-disable.jpg[Image,width=800]]

Answer 'Y' and your Windows 10 host computer will restart. After
restarting, Hyper-V support will be disabled and your Hypervisor will be
able to run the .ova image of the MSActivator installation.

Another error might appear when launching when running the MSActivator
server image for the first time after removing the Hyper-V support from
Windows 10:

link:[image:images/network_interface_change.jpg[Image,width=400]]

In that case, just click on 'Change Network Settings' and the virtual
machine will start.
