[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are required for a successful use of {product_name}:
//// 
TODO specify that its for PC and add the specification CPU, RAM,...
////

. A recent version of Git. 
. A working docker and docker-compose setup
* link:https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker]
* link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose]

== Setup requirements

=== Internet Resources
 * Ensure you have access from HOST machine(s) to:
 ** https://github.com
 ** https://hub.docker.com

=== Hardware Resources

.on a PC (for lab experimentation)
- minimum memory:4GB (8GB to be comfortable), 2CPU, 100GB

NOTE: with less that 4GB of memory, the {product_name} may not function properly.

.on a production environment 
- minimum 16GB, 4CPU, 200GB

=== Docker optional custom configuration

The custom configuration below may not be needed depending on your host computer and you intended use of the {product_name}. If you are just running the product for evaluation purpose or training, don't worry too much about these at first.

In a production environment, these custom configuration may be mandatory to allow your setup to support a higher workload.

////
=== Support for IPv6

Follow this guide to enable IPv6 on your docker engine: link:https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/[Enable IPv6 support]

You can also use the Docker console to configure IPv6.

==== Docker for Linux (or Linux VM)

----
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
echo 'vm.max_map_count = 262144' > /etc/sysctl.d/50-msa.conf
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/50-msa.conf
----

==== Docker for Mac

From the command line, run:
----
screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/tty
----	
Press enter and use`sysctl` to configure vm.max_map_count:
----
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
----	
To exit the screen session, type Ctrl a d.

.Github repository
This guide is composed of a link:https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart[git repository] which is mainly a set of Dockerfile and docker-compose.xml files to pull the {product_name} from link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub] 
////

== Mini lab creation

=== Step 1: creation

1. Check your Docker engine has access to DockerHub. You can, for instance, run `docker run hello-world` to test the access.
2. `git clone https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart.git` to clone the GitHub repository on you computer.
3. `cd quickstart`
4. `git checkout tags/{revnumber} -b {revnumber}`
5. `docker login` (check the note below)
6. `docker-compose up -d` to download and install the {product_name} containers and create the mini lab.

IMPORTANT: for `docker login`, use the Docker ID "msa2trial" and the link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/[access token] provided by your main point of contact at UBiqube. 

NOTE: If you are already running the {product_name} and wish to upgrade it to a new version check the link:#upgrade[documentation below]

NOTE: The architecture of the mini lab is detailed in this link:../admin-guide/architecture_overview{outfilesuffix}[documentation].

[#step2]
=== Step 2: install the trial license and the libraries (Microservices, Workflows and Adapters) from github.com/openmsa

The free trial license is automatically installed during this step, the license is valid for 30 days and allows the creation of 5 link:../user-guide/managed_entities{outfilesuffix}[managed entities].

`docker-compose exec msa_dev /usr/bin/install_libraries.sh all`

At the end of the script execution, you need to restart the API container and the CoreEngine container:

`docker-compose restart msa_api && docker-compose restart msa_sms`

NOTE: more explainations on the script `install_libraries.sh` can be found link:#install_librairies[here].

NOTE: The detail of what is included in the mini lab is available here: link:quickstart_packages{outfilesuffix}[mini lab packages]. 

=== Step 3: provision the mini lab with tenants, managed entities, etc.

The mini lab comes with a Linux container (linux_me / 172.20.0.101) for experimentation.

Credentials for the Linux machine are:

 - username: `msa`
 - password: `ubiqube`

In order to ease your discovery of {product_name}, we are providing a script that will create the mini lab environment for you: 

- 1 tenant - BladeRunner
- 1 subtenant - Tyrell Corporation
- a managed entity to manage the Linux container - linux_me
- some microservices and workflow to start configuring the managed entity - users, firewall, etc.

To create the mini lab environment, run the CLI command from where you have cloned the quickstart Github project:
```
$ sudo docker-compose exec msa_dev /usr/bin/create_mini_lab.sh
```

=== Step 4 (optional): Setting up log aggregation for linux_me
1. `docker-compose exec linux_me bash` issue this command from the host machine in order to connect to linux_me.
2. `[root@linux_me /]# echo '*.* @msa_front' > /etc/rsyslog.d/mini_lab.conf` to create rsyslog configuration.
3. `[root@linux_me /]# service rsyslog restart` restart the service.

Now you should start to see device logs for linux_me appearing in the alarm section of the {product_name} portal.

=== Step 5: start using the {product_name}

Browse: link:https://localhost/[window=_blank] and connect with username `ncroot` and password `ubiqube`. 

== Mini lab detailed description
=== Use case 1: firewall orchestration on Linux

This lab use case will show you in a simple way how you can use {product_name} to automate the configuration of iptables-based firewall policy on the Linux container included in the mini lab.

The development of this use case is detailled in this guide: link:../lab-guide/simple_firewall_policy_mngt{outfilesuffix}[Firewall Policy Automation]

You can use the guide to recreate the use case step by step or you may also directly run the use case with the workflow and microservices that are installed in the mini-lab.

For that, you'll have to select the subtenant named "TYRELL CORPORATION," click on the link "Automation" on the left menu and select the tab "Workflows." The workflow to use is "Simple Firewall (Python)."

== Mini lab additional info

[#upgrade]
=== Fresh install or upgrade ?

The quickstart repository is maintained on https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart and the latest version is available on the branch master.

If you are upgrading your {product_name}, you can either do a clean install for the quickstart by removing your docker containers and the quickstart directory and go to step 2. above or you can update your quickstart with `cd quickstart` and checkout the latest version you want to upgrade to.

NOTE: In case you have updated the {product_name} with `docker-compose up -d` or `docker-compose pull`, you might experience cache issues (for instance, your changes may not be reflected on the UI). To solve that, you can clean your browser cache, or use a browser private session.

=== Upgrade version N to N+1

Starting from it's version 2.2.0, the quickstart project provides a script `upgrade.sh` for taking care of possible upgrade actions such as recreate some volumes, execute some database specific updates, update the libraries,...

Let's say that you are running the version {revnumber-prev}, to upgrade to the version {revnumber} you need to follow these steps:

1. `docker login` (in case you are not authenticated yet)
2. `cd quickstart`
3. `git checkout master`
4. `git pull`
5. `git fetch --all --tags`
6. `git checkout tags/{revnumber} -b {revnumber}`
7. `./scripts/upgrade.sh` 

NOTE: when running the upgrade script, it will ask you if you want your local librairies to be updated with the latest version from the community. If you answer 'y', the update will be done automatically. You can also do the update later manually on the container `msa_dev`.

==== Note for Windows user

If you are running docker natively on Windows, the script upgrade.sh may not work. In that case you need to execute manually the Docker CLI commands to upgrade your setup:

1. `docker-compose down`
2. `sms_php_vol=$(docker volume ls | awk '{print $2}' | grep msa_sms_php)`
3. `docker volume rm $sms_php_vol`
4. `sms_devices_vol=$(docker volume ls | awk '{print $2}' | grep msa_sms_devices)`
5. `docker volume rm $sms_devices_vol`
6. `dev_vol=$(docker volume ls | awk '{print $2}' | grep msa_dev)`
7. `docker volume rm $dev_vol`
8. `docker-compose up -d --build`
9. `docker-compose exec msa_dev rm -rf /opt/fmc_repository/Process/Reference`
10. `docker-compose exec msa_dev /usr/bin/install_libraries.sh all --no-lic`
11. `docker-compose restart msa_api && docker-compose restart msa_sms`
12. `msa_api=$(docker ps -q -f name=msa_api)`
13: `docker exec -it -u root $msa_api crond`


=== Install a specific version

For each release of the {product_name}, there is a tag that you can use if you need to install a specific version of the product.

To install a tagged version, you can checkout the tag and go to the install steps above.

For example, the CLI command below will checkout the quickstart for the release {revnumber}.

`git checkout tags/{revnumber} -b {revnumber}`

The releases and tags are available link:https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart/releases[here]

[#install_libraries]
=== install_libraries script

The script `install_libraries.sh` is installed in the container link:../admin-guide/architecture_overview{outfilesuffix}#_msa_dev[msa_dev]

This script is designed to populate the libraries for a fresh install or to update your libraries with the latest version from Github.

[source, shell]
----
$ docker-compose exec msa_dev /usr/bin/install_libraries.sh --help
usage: install_libraries.sh all|ms|wf|da [--no-lic] [-y]

this script installs some librairies available @github.com/openmsa

Commands:
all:          install everything: worflows, microservices and adapters
ms:           install the microservices from https://github.com/openmsa/Microservices
wf:           install the worflows from https://github.com/openmsa/Workflows
da:           install the adapters from https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters
Options:
--no-lic:     skip license installation
-y:           answer yes for all questions
----

In case of calling this script on an existing setup, it will take care of merging the code from the Github master branch into your local development branch. With the option `-y`, an automated merge will be attempted, without the option, the script will ask for user input.

IMPORTANT: when running the script on an existing setup, use the option `--no-lic` to make sure that your current license is not overwritten by a new trial license.
