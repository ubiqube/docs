== Device Activation

The activation of a device (also known as Initial Provisioning) is the
action that will check the device connectivity, optionally configure it
with an initial (templated) configuration, and mark it as activated.

Once activated, the MSActivator can manage and monitor the device.

The steps to activate a device are:

From the Device page, in the "Details" tab, select "Initial
provisioning" from the "Actions" drop down. This will activate the
Device.
