== Repository Icons and Behaviours 

The configuration repository is used to store configuration files which
can later be used in file-based configuration profiles or directly
attached to devices.

[[ConfigurationRepository-ActionsontheRepositoryRootNode]]
=== Actions on the Repository Root Node 

[[ConfigurationRepository-AddinganOperator]]
==== Adding an Operator 

image:images/Add_operator.gif[image,width=16,height=16] : adds an
operator to this repository. This action is only relevant for users that
have an administrator role.

[[ConfigurationRepository-GettingInformationAbouttheRepository]]
==== Getting Information About the Repository 

image:images/Help.gif[image,width=16,height=16] : displays the list of
profiles that use files from this repository or the devices that use
files from this repository

[[ConfigurationRepository-ActionsontheOperatorNodes]]
=== Actions on the Operator Nodes 

As one or more operator(s) can be associated with a configuration
repository, an operator can be associated with a customer or a
manufacturer.

[[ConfigurationRepository-AddingaCustomer]]
==== Adding a Customer 

image:images/Add_customer.gif[image,width=16,height=16] : the user can
select and add one or several customers from its managed customer.
Adding a customer acts as a filter: any file uploaded to a customer
sub-folder will only be available to the selected customer.

[[ConfigurationRepository-AddingaManufacturer]]
==== Adding a Manufacturer 

image:images/Add_manufacturer.gif[image,width=16,height=16] : the user
can select and add the managed device manufacturers. Adding a
manufacturer acts as a filter and any file uploaded to a manufacturer
sub-folder will only be available to the selected manufacturer.

[[ConfigurationRepository-ActionsontheCustomerNode]]
=== Actions on the Customer Node 

image:images/Add_manufacturer.gif[image,width=16,height=16] : the user
can select and add the managed device manufacturers. Files uploaded to a
sub-folder of this selected manufacturer will only be available for the
devices of the selected manufacturer that are attached to the selected
customer.

=== Adding/Removing Folders and Files and Adding Files 

==== Adding/Removing folders and files 

image:images/Add_directory.gif[image,width=16,height=16] : the user can
add a sub-folder to any of the following: customer, manufacturer or
folder. image:images/Action_delete.gif[image,width=14,height=16] : the
user can delete any of the following: customer, manufacturer, folder or
file. The delete action is not available if the object is attached to a
configuration profile or a device, or if the object is a folder and
contains a file attached to a configuration profile or a device.
Hovering over the image:images/Help.gif[image,width=16,height=16] icon
displays the list of the profiles and devices that have a reference to
any of the files in the corresponding sub-tree.

[[ConfigurationRepository-Addingfiles]]
==== Adding files 

image:images/Add_upload_Configuration.gif[image,width=16,height=16] :
the user can add a file to the selected folder. Via the dialog window,
the user can either upload a file
(image:images/Action_upload.gif[image,width=16,height=16] Import from
disk) from their file system or directly create a file
(image:images/Modify.gif[image,width=16,height=16] Create new file).

Only text files can be uploaded in the configuration repository. Binary
file upload is not supported.

If the user chooses to create a new file
(image:images/Modify.gif[image,width=16,height=16]), they will be able
to create it via the edition window:

link:[image:images/CreateNewFile_win.png[Image,width=682]]

A name, a tag, and a free text comment can be given to the new file.

[[ConfigurationRepository-Addingzippedfilesforbulkupload]]
==== Adding zipped files for bulk upload 

image:images/Add_upload_Configuration.gif[image,width=16,height=16] :
The user can add a set of files and/or a full directory structure to the
selected folder by uploading a .zip file.

Note: the unzipping process will preserve the directory structure of the
zipped directory and files.

Via the dialog window, the user can upload a zip file
(image:images/Action_upload.gif[image,width=16,height=16] Import from
disk) from his file system.

Only zip-compressed archives are supported at this time. Only text files
or folders inside the zip are supported.

A name, a tag and a free text comment can be given to the new zip file.

[[ConfigurationRepository-AddingfilesinfolderAutoAttached]]
==== Adding files in folder AutoAttached 

It is possible to automatically attach files to a device when the device
is created.

This is useful when services are to be automatically associated with
devices.

In order to define the set of files (templates or objects) that should
be associated with a device, the files should be uploaded under a folder
that goes by the name "AutoAttached". There is no dedicated action
button to create this folder, therefore it is up to the MSA admin to
make sure that the folder name and location are correct.

The folder AutoAttached must be created under a model folder, otherwise,
the files it contains will not be taken into account.

In the screenshot below, each file found below AutoAttached will be
automatically attached to newly created Fortinet/Generic.

[[ConfigurationRepository-Usingconfigurationvariablesintherepositoryfiles]]
==== Using c[.mw-redirect]##onfiguration variables## in the repository files 

The file can contain any text and reference to
c[.mw-redirect]##onfiguration variables## and can be used with the
following syntax:

The variable MY_VAR can be defined for a device. Use the \{$MY_VAR}
syntax to reference the configuration templates.

Below is an example of IP SLA configuration for Cisco routers:

....
                                    
! begin ipsla con
ip sla {$operation_number
icmp-echo {$destination_ip_address}
frequency {$seconds
exi

 
ip sla schedule {$operation_number} life {$life} start-time {$start_time
! end ipsla con

 
in orderfothe configuration to be correctly pushed to a device, the device must have the following variables declared and valued
operation_numbe
destination_ip_addres
second
operation_numbe
lif
start_tim
....
