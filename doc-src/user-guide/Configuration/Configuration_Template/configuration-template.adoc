== Configuration Template at the Profile Level

Configuration templates can be grouped together using a
link:configuration-profile{outfilesuffix}Configuration Profile].

link:../../Getting Started/managed-devices{outfilesuffix}Managed devices] can be attached to
a link:../configuration-profile{outfilesuffix}Configuration Profile].

This is useful when a managed service is defined as a group of
configuration templates and/or Microservices, and has to be applied
consistently to multiple link:../../Getting Started/managed-devices{outfilesuffix}Managed devices].

The SecEngine module will resolve the template for each device's
configuration variables and update the device's configuration, one by
one, with the created configuration.

NOTE: It is possible to add a specific template per device (see section
below).

== Configuration Template at the Device Level

In addition to the configuration profile, it is possible to associate a
template directly to a device.

=== How to add configuration templates to a device

From the device home page menu, select *General -> Edit Configuration
Files*

Adding configuration templates to a device is similar to adding a
template to a configuration profile:

1.  Select a template from the
link:../configuration-repository{outfilesuffix}Configuration Repository].
2.  Configure the variables attached to the template on the bottom
panel.
3.  Save.

=== Viewing attached files

From the device home page, select the *Configuration files* tab:

https://d20ftpvh66dtxq.cloudfront.net/Device_config_files.png[image:https://d20ftpvh66dtxq.cloudfront.net/Device_config_files.png[Image,width=800]]

This tab shows all the templates attached to the device.

* In black: the template that are directly attached to the device
* In gray: the templates that are attached to a profile (if the device
is attached to a configuration profile)

indicate if the template was attached as a pre-configuration or a
post-configuration template.

=== Viewing the resolved templates

As explained in the
link:../configuration-repository{outfilesuffix}Configuration Repository]
page, configuration files that can be uploaded in the repository are
templates. +
Therefore, they contain variables that have to be declared.

Templates can also contain variables coming from the database. The
variables are available through the entry point *\{$SD}* see:
link:database-template-variables{outfilesuffix}Database template
variables]

Once templates are associated to a device (directly or through a
profile), it is possible to view the resulting configuration file:

* Right click on the attached file and choose *View generated file*:
