The variable type composite provide the means to add control over the
behaviour of the Microservice user form.

It can be used for instance to show/hide part of the form based on the
value of another component of the form.

As in the example below: if 'show A' is checked to true, the field 'A'
is displayed

otherwise it's hidden.

In order to implement this behaviour with the Microservice designer the
variables should be defined as below

The state of $param.a depends on the value of $param.show therefore the
type of $param.a should be set to 'Composite' and the 'advanced
parameters of $param.a have to be edited to configure its behaviour.

In the section 'Type', when type is set to Composite the fields
'Selector variable' and 'Selector values' are displayed.

The field 'Selector variable' will list all other variables that could
be used to control the behaviour of the current variable.

The values for the selector will depend on the type of the selector.

For example true/false will be available for boolean variable but for
other types  such as String, it's possible to use predefined values or
set some specific value.

NOTE: Regarding the variable type Composite, the section "Name",
"Values", "Other parameter" should not be used. Instead, configuration
has to be done with the advanced parameter of each selector value.
