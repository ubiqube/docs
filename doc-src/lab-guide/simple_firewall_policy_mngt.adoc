This documentation will guide you through the implementation of a simple workflow to block a source IP and a destination port on a Linux based VNF

== Overview

This firewall policy management tutorial will show you:

- how to use the Microservices and the Workflows to create a layer of abstraction on top of your managed entities.
- how to call a Microservice from a Workflow
- how to design a simple workflow in Python

The firewall will be implemented by a Linux VNF and we will use link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables[iptables] to configure the security policies.

NOTE: This tutorial can be implemented with the link:../admin-guide/installation{outfilesuffix}#mini-lab[mini lab] and its Linux based managed entity.

The high level specifications for this use case are:

- The user must be able to specify an IP address and a service (network port) on the workflow end-user UI console
- The user must be able to select a managed entity to configure
- The workflow will use the two parameters IP and port to automatically configure the firewall selected by the user

== Implementation
=== Microservice design
==== Firewall Implementation on Linux

- Based on Linux iptables
- Takes an IP and a port as parameters

===== Iptables

Below are some sample iptable CLI commands used to perform IP/port based filtering

.Create a rule
[source]
----
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport <PORT TO BLOCK> -s <IP TO BLOCK> -j DROP
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport <PORT TO BLOCK> -s <IP TO BLOCK> -j DROP
----

.Get the list of rules
[source]
----
iptables -L INPUT -n | grep -v Chain | grep -v target
----
Returns
[source]
----
DROP       tcp  --  92.103.182.20        0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:
DROP       tcp  --  92.103.182.20        0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:80
[source]
----

===== Implementation steps

These are the steps to follow to build the Microservice. 
These steps are the usual steps designing and developping Microservices.

- Step 1: Create a new Microservice in the repository.
- Step 2: Implement the CREATE command.
- Step 3: Implement the IMPORT command.
- Step 4: Implement the DELETE command.
- Step 5: Test and check the Linux vFW via the command line interface.

==== Create a new microservice

Create a new microservice `simple_firewall` 

image:images/simple_firewall_new_ms.png[width=600px]

NOTE: You can refer to the documentation on link:microservice_editor{outfilesuffix}[microservice editor] to learn how to create a new link:../user-guide/microservices{outfilesuffix}[microservice].

==== Implement the CREATE command

The creation of a filtering rule using iptable can be implemented with the CLI command below:

[source]
----
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport <PORT TO BLOCK> -s <IP TO BLOCK> -j DROP
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport <PORT TO BLOCK> -s <IP TO BLOCK> -j DROP
----
These commands take 2 parameters, a port and an IP address.

Add a CREATE function to your microservice and copy the implementation below:
[source]
----
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport {$params.dst_port} -s {$params.src_ip} -j DROP
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport {$params.dst_port} -s {$params.src_ip}  -j DROP
----

image:images/simple_firewall_ms_create_func.png[width=600px]

You need to create the 2 variables `dst_port` and `src_ip` as well as `object_id` which is a mandatory variable.

image:images/simple_firewall_ms_variables.png[width=600px]


At this point the microservice is ready for a first test. 
Use a link:../user-guide/configuration_deployment_settings{outfilesuffix}[deployment setting] to associate it to your link:../user-guide/managed_entities{outfilesuffix}[managed entity]

Save and close, select managed entity and click on the tab "configure", select the microservice simple_firewall and click on "+ Add Row"

image:images/simple_firewall_test_ms.png[width=600px]

Please make sure linux_me is activated, otherwise "Activate" it.
Then click "Apply Changes".

Once the configuration has been applied, you can connect to the managed entity CLI and verify that iptables was configured as expected.
[source]
----
$ docker-compose exec linux_me bash

[root@linux_me /]# sudo iptables --line-numbers -L INPUT -n
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
DROP       tcp  --  192.168.23.45        0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:2345 
----

==== Implement the IMPORT command

Once you are able to create new rules, you need to make sure that the {product_name} microservice database is reflecting the configuration on the managed entity.
To acheive that, you need to implement the IMPORT function.

The role of the IMPORT command is to import the current device configuration into the {product_name} database.

The implementation of the IMPORT is based on a set of regular expressions that build a parser that will extract the values of the Microservice variables.

The IMPORT is made of 3 parts:

- the command to run on the device (for CLI command based device).
- the configuration parser, implemented with a set of regular expressions. Only the Microservice identifier extractor is mandatory.
- a set of optional post-import operations implemented in Smarty language (https://www.smarty.net/).

===== Command to run on the device

To list the iptables rules the CLI command to use is: 

[source]
----
# sudo iptables -L INPUT -n
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
DROP       tcp  --  192.168.1.2          0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:80 
DROP       tcp  --  192.168.1.4          0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:443  
----

We can add some "grep" commands to remove the lines that starts with "Chain" and "target" and therefore ease the parsing of the output.

NOTE: The use of grep here is a straightforward way, specific to this use case, to have a simple and easy to parse output. The same result could also be achieved by adding a parser instruction to ignore the first 2 lines starting with "Chain" and "target".

[source]
----
# sudo iptables --line-numbers -L INPUT -n | grep -v Chain | grep -v num
1    DROP       tcp  --  192.168.1.2          0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:80 
2    DROP       tcp  --  192.168.1.4          0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:443 
----

===== Identifier extractor

The identifier extracter will parse each line and assign the rule ID to the Microservice variable object_id.

Since the rule contains the other variables on the same line, the identifier extractor will also extract the source IP and the destination port.

The regular expression below will extract the object_id, the src_ip and the dst_port.
----
(?<object_id>\d+)\s+DROP\s+tcp\s+--\s+(?<src_ip>([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3})[^:]+:(?<dst_port>\d+)
----

image:images/simple_firewall_ms_import_func.png[width=600px]

==== Test and check the Linux vFW via the command line interface

The microservice is ready to be tested. 

Make sure that you can add and delete a policy rule, that it's reflected on the Linux firewall, and that the parameters are also properly synchronised after a call to CREATE or DELETE.

You can also add some iptables rules manually on the Linux CLI and run a configuration synchronisation to make sure that your manual changes are properly imported.

.Example
Add another IP to block.
----
[root@linux_me /]# sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2345 -s 192.168.67.98 -j DROP
[root@linux_me /]# sudo iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport 2345 -s 192.168.67.98 -j DROP
[root@linux_me /]# sudo iptables -L INPUT -n
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
DROP       tcp  --  192.168.23.45        0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:2345 
DROP       tcp  --  192.168.67.98        0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:2345 
----

And use "Synchronize with Managed Entity" to import the new rule in the configuration database.

image:images/simple_firewall_ms_import_new_rule.png[width=600px]

==== Implement the DELETE command

The deletion of the iptables INPUT and FORWARD rules is executed with the CLI command below:

[source]
----
sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport <PORT TO BLOCK>  -s <IP TO BLOCK>  -j DROP 
sudo iptables -D FORWARD -p tcp --dport <PORT TO BLOCK>  -s <IP TO BLOCK>  -j DROP 
----

This will be written in the Delete command of the microservice as:

[source]
----
sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport {$simple_firewall.$object_id.dst_port} -s {$simple_firewall.$object_id.src_ip} -j DROP
sudo iptables -D FORWARD -p tcp --dport {$simple_firewall.$object_id.dst_port} -s {$simple_firewall.$object_id.src_ip} -j DROP
----

****
IMPORTANT: The syntax `{$simple_firewall.$object_id.dst_port}` provides a way to access the Microservice variable values in the MSActivator configuration database. 

The convention is as follow:
----
{$<MICROSERVICE NAME>.$object_id.<VARIABLE NAME>}
----
In our case:

MICROSERVICE NAME => simple_firewall 

VARIABLE NAME => dst_port

MICROSERVICE NAME is the name of the Microservice file without the .xml extension.

.Example
simple_firewall.xml => simple_firewall
****

==== Conclusion

With the microservice design, you have been defining an abstraction layer on top of a security VNF. 
This Microservice defines de facto an API for a simple firewall management.
You can call the Create/Update/Delete function of the microservice `simple_firewall` from a script or a third party REST client.

----
command CREATE
parameters {"simple_firewall":{"44":{"dst_port":"9876","object_id":"44","src_ip":"192.168.23.1"}}}
----

This use case could be extended to other vendors provided that the microservices are defining the same variables: dst_port, src_ip, object_id (which is mandatory)

=== Workflow design

In this section you are going to create a workflow on top of the microservice.

You will see that the implementation of the workflow doesn't not depend on the vendor provided that some condition on the microservice design are met:

- the name of the microservice should be the same for every supported vendor.
- each vendor microservice will have to implement the same set of variables.

The workflow will be a very simple workflow with 3 processes, implemented in python.

- process `Create Firewall Service` (type CREATE)
- process `Add Filter Rule` (type UPDATE)
- process `Delete Service` (type DELETE)

==== Create a new workflow

image:images/simple_firewall_new_wf.png[width=600px]

IMPORTANT: set the workflow language to *python* and set *service_id* as the workflow variable name.

==== Add the variables

You need 4 variables to map with the simple_firewall microservice:

- id: for the firewall rule ID - type: Integer
- src_ip: for the source IP to block - type: String
- dst_port: for the destination port to block - type: Integer
- device: to allow the user to select the managed entity to configure - type: Device

image:images/simple_firewall_wf_variables.png[width=600px]

NOTE: the type Device is a special type that will let the user select a managed entity from the process execution screen

==== Implement the processes
Create the processes and for each processes add a task.

Make sure that each process type is correcty set as detailed above.

The source code below can be direclty copied in the tasks.

==== Run the workflow

Go to the "Automation" section of your sub-tenant and select the workflow.

Click on "+ Create Firewall Service" (this action is generated based on the name of the process type CREATE), select a managed entity and click "Run"

image:images/simple_firewall_wf_exec_create.png[]

A new instance of the workflow is now created and you can call the process to create a firewall rule with "Add Filter Rule"

image:images/simple_firewall_wf_exec_update.png[]

Delete the instance with the process "Delete Service"
