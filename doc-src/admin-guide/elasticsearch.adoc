== Overview

The {product_name} uses Elasticsearch and Kibana to provide data indexing and searching as well as the dashboards that can be customized and exposed with a custom manager dashboard.

== Data Retention Policy

Data retention policy allows to configure and manage the lifecycle of the indexes in Elasticsearch.

There are 3 main types of indexes such as the ones used for the syslogs (`ubilogs-\*`), the alarms (`ubialarms-*`) or the audit logs (`ubiaudit-*`). 
For each type, the data is stored in a daily index.
A new index is created every days.

A log retention policy can be configured for each type and a specific policy may be assigned for each index.

For example, you may want to keep the syslogs indexed and online (searchable with the {product_name} UI) for 3 months, but the alarms should be kept for a longer period of time like 1 year.

You can learn how to configure the retention policies by reading the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html[Elasticsearch ILM,window=_blank] documentation.

The ILM configuration is done with the Kibana UI (http://localhost/kibana), in the Stack Management section, under Index Lifecycle Policies

== Online and offline storage

=== Elasticsearch ILM

Offline storage is for historical logs.
For example, with a 1 year retention period, the storage is split between 1 month online and 11 months offline.

Online storage will be available for the logs that are less than 1 months old. The online storage is leveraging Elasticsearch data nodes to allow searching, alarm and dashboard.

Offline storage will be available for the logs that are within the time range between 1 months and 1 year.

Snapshot policies require a link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.14/snapshots-register-repository.html#snapshots-register-repository[snapshot repository].

A shared file system repository can be used to store snapshots on a shared file system using NFS.

The NFS mount should be shared between the snapshot storage and all the Elasticsearch master and data nodes. It is not required for the client nodes.

Snapshot and ILM policies can work together to manage online, offline and deletion of the data.

=== Advanced log retention control

With Elasticsearch built-in ILM, you can provide a high level control over the data retention period and manage but sometime log retention policy require a more advanced policy based on criteria such as the type of log.

As simple use case we can consider the collection of firewall logs. Firewalls are very "chatty" when it comes to sending data. Logs such as system, traffic, security or SNMP traps can be collected by the {product_name}. In order to reduce the storage size, keeping system and traffic data for a short period of time can be acceptable will keeping the security event for a longer period of time may be required for legal reason.

The {product_name} advanced data retention feature allows the configuration of multiple rules to control the criteria for deleting data.  

This feature is maintained by the `msa2-es-ilm` container included in the Quickstart

The retention policy is controlled by the environment variables below

    UBI_ES_INDEX_MULTIPLE_TTL:         "*|90d"
    UBI_ES_AUDIT_INDEX_MULTIPLE_TTL:   "*|90d"
    UBI_ES_ALARM_INDEX_MULTIPLE_TTL:   "*|90d"

Variable value is a comma separated list of key|value. The key is an Elasticsearch query for filtering the data to delete, the value represent the retention period. 
By default logs, alarms and audit logs are deleted after 90d stored online in Elasticsearch cluster.

The configuration below will:

* keep the traffic logs for 7 days
* the event logs for 30d 
* delete everything older that 90 days

    UBI_ES_INDEX_MULTIPLE_TTL:          "type:traffic|7d,type:event|30d,*|90d

the name of the field (ex `traffic`) can be adjusted based on the data structure as stored in Elasticsearch    

Below is another configuration that will:

* delete the alarm with a low severity (debug, informational, notice, warning) after 7 days
* delete the alarm with medium severity (error) after 30 days
* delete everything older that 90 days

      UBI_ES_ALARM_INDEX_MULTIPLE_TTL:   "severity:[4 TO 7]|7d,severity:3|30d,*|90d"
