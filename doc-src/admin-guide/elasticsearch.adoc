== Overview

The {product_name} uses Elasticsearch and Kibana to provide data indexing and searching as well as the dashboards that can be customized and exposed with a custom manager dashboard.

== Log Retention Policy

Log retention policy allows to configure and manage the lifecycle of the indexes in Elasticsearch.

There are 3 main types of indexes such as the ones used for the syslogs (`ubilogs-\*`), the alarms (`ubialarms-*`) or the audit logs (`ubiaudit-*`). 
For each type, the data is stored in a daily index.
A new index is created every days.

A log retention policy can be configured for each type and a specific policy may be assigned for each index.

For example, you may want to keep the syslogs indexed and online (searchable with the {product_name} UI) for 3 months, but the alarms should be kept for a longer period of time like 1 year.

You can learn how to configure the retention policies by reading the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html[Elasticsearch ILM,window=_blank] documentation.

The ILM configuration is done with the Kibana UI (http://localhost/kibana), in the Stack Management section, under Index Lifecycle Policies

== Online and offline storage

Offline storage is for historical logs.
For example, with a 1 year retention period, the storage is split between 1 month online and 11 months offline.

Online storage will be available for the logs that are less than 1 months old. The online storage is leveraging Elasticsearch data nodes to allow searching, alarm and dashboard.

Offline storage will be available for the logs that are within the time range between 1 months and 1 year.

Snapshot policies require a link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.14/snapshots-register-repository.html#snapshots-register-repository[snapshot repository].

A shared file system repository can be used to store snapshots on a shared file system using NFS.

The NFS mount should be shared between the snapshot storage and all the Elasticsearch master and data nodes. It is not required for the client nodes.

Snapshot and ILM policies can work together to manage online, offline and deletion of the data.
