== Overview

The {product_name} provides support for high avalability, based on "Docker Engine Swarm" mode.

image:ha_containers.png[overall architecture,width=700px]

With docker swarm, there is two types of nodes link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/nodes/#manager-nodes[managers] and link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/nodes/#worker-nodes[workers].

Manager nodes handle cluster management tasks such as:

* maintaining cluster state
* scheduling services
* serving swarm mode HTTP API endpoints

=> A swarm with 3 managers will tolerates a maximum loss of 1 manager

=> Adding more managers does NOT mean increased scalability or higher performance. In general, the opposite is true.


*Worker nodes* are also instances of Docker Engine but their sole purpose is to execute containers.
Worker nodes donâ€™t participate in the Raft distributed state, make scheduling decisions, or serve the swarm mode HTTP API.

=== Configure manager nodes for fault tolerance

Based on docker link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/admin_guide/#add-manager-nodes-for-fault-tolerance[documentation], it's better to maintain an odd number of managers in the swarm to support manager node failure.

* Smarm size : number of manager nodes in your HA setup
* Majority : minimum number of manager nodes required for the stability of HA platform (quorum)
* Fault tolerance: number of manager nodes you can lose and still have a stable setup

|===
|Swarm Size | Majority | Fault Tolerance
| 1| 1| 0
| 2| 2| 0
| 3| 2| 1
| 4| 3| 1
| 5| 3| 2

=== Roles of each container

[cols=5*,options="header",width=90%]
|===
| Name | Role | Size | Load profile | Backup required (yes/no)
| *API*	| The REST API (Wildfly) used by our web UI to execute core MSActivator functionality.  All core functionality in MSActivator is driven by REST APIs.  You can also call these directly, by-passing the UI if you wish.	| L	| API traffic. Medium-high CPU and RAM usage, depending on how many Workflows are being executed, web UI traffic, and general REST API usage. *Scale up* API containers to handle higher API load.|	No
| *BUD*	| Batch update service in charge of copying data from customer database (UI) to sec engine database (SMS).	| S	| Similar to SMS itself, scale up for handling higher managed entity loads.|	No
| *CAM*	| BPM engine (Camunda).	| L	| BPM processing. Medium-high CPU and RAM usage, depending on how many BPMs are executed in the deployment. *Scale up* CAM containers to handle a higher BPM execution load.|	No
| *CER*	| Elasticsearch index management web interface (Cerebo)	| S	| Small amount of web traffic ({product_name} admins), used to manage Elasticsearch indexes.  One instance is sufficient, MSActivator can run without Cerebo so no need to load balance this container.|	No
| *DB*	| The database (PostgreSQL) that is used internally by MSActivator to store application data in.	| L	| Primary database used by MSActivator.  API, and therefore web UI traffic, results in database queries. *Scale up* in a replicated configuration for higher loads (CPU).  As MSActivator stores syslogs in ES and not DB, DB (PostgreSQL) data growth tends to be small.|Yes
| *DEV*	| Contains your library code, for example workflows, microservices, BPMs, and device adaptors that you use in your MSActivator deployment.  Custom automatons you create via the web UI are stored here (on a network file mount that you can back up).	| M	| Mainly disc I/O (reading files, saving files etc.).  No business logic, this container is mainly a file mount.  You should create that mount outside of the container (e.g. a NAS), and backup that storage.  Disc space usage is low (depending on how big your libraries are).|	Yes
| *ES* | The big data engine (Elasticsearch) that is used by MSActivator to optionally store managed entity syslogs too. The required search index used by the UI is also stored here.| XL	| Search indexing and querying traffic.  On light usage, the search index used to drive the UI search in MSActivator is stored here.  On heavy usage, the managed entity syslogs are collected and stored here.  Under heavy usage (CPU, RAM, disc I/O). *Scale up* in a clustered configuration.| Yes
| *Front* | Nginx, acts as a proxy that exposes ports that can be accessed from outside of the MSActivator installation (web UI, REST API etc.).	| S	| Web and API traffic.  No business processing or data management, simple proxy server with low CPU and RAM usage.|	No
| *linux_me* ("Quickstart" only)	| Linux container used as a lab managed entitiy for demo only, useful for training.  Not required in production deployments.| S	| Very light local traffic, only for demo, training, or development purposes.  No need to deploy this container in production, can ignore.|	No
| *SMS*	| CoreEngine for managing entities, pushing configuration and collecting syslogs.	| S	| Runs Linux daemons for managing entities.  Medium-high CPU, RAM, and disc I/O depending on how many entities are being managed in the deployment. *Scale up* when more entities need to be managed|	No
| *UI* | Runs the portal web UI on an Nginx web server| S	| Web traffic.  No business processing or data management, all handled by the API backend.  The UI is just a presentation layer.  Low CPU and RAM usage. |	No
|===

=== Recommended container sizes

1. Containers use the resources of the server hosting them (no hard limits per container).
2. Point 1. above is important when you can deploy multiple containers per host: simple add the specs for each container together to get the correct size for the server that hosts them.
3. Persistent file storage (database files, ES indexes etc.) should be stored outside of Docker containers, and mounted to those containers for required access.

[cols=2*,options="header",width=50%]
|===
| Size  | Resources
| XS    | 1 CPU, 1 GB RAM, 50 GB disc
| S     | 2 CPU, 2 GB RAM, 100 GB disc
| M     | 2 CPU, 4 GB RAM, 250 GB disc
| L     | 4 CPU, 8 GB RAM, 500 GB disc
| XL    | 8 CPU, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB disc
|===

=== Customer profiles for HA

To help you define containers needs based on your requirement, here 4 customers profiles.

Depending to new numbers of containers, VM can be scaled to create docker manager nodes and worker nodes.


==== Simple: HA platform with minimum activities 

image:ha_profile_1.png[width=250px]

==== Standard: HA platform with mix of activities

image:ha_profile_2.png[width=250px]

==== Automation: Execute many WF and BPM

image:ha_profile_3.png[width=250px]

==== Assurance: Collect syslogs and monitor entities

image:ha_profile_4.png[width=250px]

== Prerequisites

MSA High Availability is built upon Docker Engine Swarm mode, and requires:

 * At least three VMs deployed:
 ** Docker Swarm Manager1
 ** Docker Swarm Manager2
 ** Docker Swarm Manager3
 
 * A shared mount point (from a NAS or Global File System):
 ** Mount point on all VMs is `/mnt/NASVolume`. All those folders must be created manually to have HA platform working correctly
 
 *** msa_api
 *** msa_db
 *** msa_dev
 *** msa_entities
 *** msa_es
 *** msa_front
 *** msa_repository
 *** msa_svn
 *** rrd_repository with inside sub folders monitor, ping and snmp
 
 
 * Each machine should have link:https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] and link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker compose] installed.

NOTE: The IP address of the manager machine must be assigned to a network interface available to the host operating system. All nodes in the swarm need to connect to the manager at the IP address.

Because other nodes contact the manager node on its IP address, you should use a fixed IP address.

* The following ports must be available on Manager node (see below link:#configure_firewall[configure the firewall] on how to configure this on CentOS 7):
 ** TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications
 ** TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes
 ** UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic

NOTE: If you plan on creating an overlay network with encryption (--opt encrypted), you also need to ensure ip protocol 50 (ESP) traffic is allowed.

More information about Docker Engine Swarm available here: link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/[swarm tutorial].


== Installing the application in HA mode

=== Enable Docker swarm mode

To enable swarm mode on the "Docker Swarm Manager" machine:
```
$ sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr <SWARM MANAGER IP>
```
Replace *SWARM MANAGER IP* with your Swarm Manager IP address. 

Normal output contains "docker swarm join" command:
```
Swarm initialized: current node (efkok8n0eiy4f6xu48zaro3x8) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4okdpjkrwzocwgqor1o9r5ck0xah646emhtgf9d3t4f4n11jgn-5a9ms5okxyxzjmcbz09pc9ujq <SWARM MANAGER IP>:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```
To enable swarm mode on Workers:
```
$ sudo docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4okdpjkrwzocwgqor1o9r5ck0xah646emhtgf9d3t4f4n11jgn-5a9ms5okxyxzjmcbz09pc9ujq <SWARM MANAGER IP>:2377
```
Normally you should see:
```
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```

WARNING: In case of any error like: Error response from daemon: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = all SubConns are in TransientFailure, latest connection error: 
connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 10.31.1.172:2377: connect: no route to host"  Check for Iptables rules on the manager node.

NOTE: To disable the swarm mode `$ sudo docker swarm leave --force`

[#configure_firewall]
== Firewall configuration

FirewallD is the default firewall application on CentOS 7, but on a new CentOS 7 server, it is disabled out of the box. So letâ€™s enable it and add the network ports necessary for Docker Swarm to function.

Before starting, verify its status (use sudo if you don't have root privileges):

`systemctl status firewalld`

It should not be running, so start it (if it's not installed, use `yum install firewalld` to install it:

`systemctl start firewalld`

Then enable it so that it starts on boot:

`systemctl enable firewalld`

On the node that will be a Swarm manager, use the following commands to open the necessary ports:

----
firewall-cmd --add-port=2376/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=2377/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=7946/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=7946/udp --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=4789/udp --permanent
----

NOTE: Note: If you make a mistake and need to remove an entry, type: `firewall-cmd --remove-port=port-number/tcp â€”permanent`. 

Afterwards, reload the firewall:

`firewall-cmd --reload`

Then restart Docker.

`systemctl restart docker`

Then on each node that will function as a Swarm worker, execute the following commands:

----
firewall-cmd --add-port=2376/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=7946/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=7946/udp --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=4789/udp --permanent
----

Afterwards, reload the firewall:

`firewall-cmd --reload`

Then restart Docker.

`systemctl restart docker`

Youâ€™ve successfully used FirewallD to open the necessary ports for Docker Swarm.


=== Ouside network access

If youâ€™ll be testing applications on the cluster that require outside network access, be sure to open the necessary ports. 

For example, if youâ€™ll be testing a Web application that requires access on port 80, add a rule that grants access to that port using the following command on all the nodes (managers and workers) in the cluster:

`firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp --permanent`

Remember to reload the firewall when you make this change.
