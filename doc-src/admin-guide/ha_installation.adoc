== Overview

The {product_name} provide support for high avalability with Docker swarm mode.

image:images/ha_containers.png[overall architecture]

== Prerequisites

MSA High Availability built upon Docker Engine Swarm mode, and requires:

 * At least three VMs deployed:
 ** Docker Swarm Manager
 ** Docker Swarm Worker1
 ** Docker Swarm Worker2
 
 * A shared mount point (from a NAS or Global File System):
 ** Mount point on all VMs is `/mnt/NASVolume`
 
 * Each machine should have link:https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] and link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker compose] installed.

NOTE: The IP address of the manager machine must be assigned to a network interface available to the host operating system. All nodes in the swarm need to connect to the manager at the IP address.
Because other nodes contact the manager node on its IP address, you should use a fixed IP address.

* The following ports must be available on Manager node:
 ** TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications
 ** TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes
 ** UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic

NOTE: If you plan on creating an overlay network with encryption (--opt encrypted), you also need to ensure ip protocol 50 (ESP) traffic is allowed.

More information Docker Engine Swarm mode you may find here: link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/[Swarm Tutorial].


== Installing the application in HA mode

=== Enable Docker swarm mode

To enable swarm mode on "Docker Swarm Manager" machine:
```
$ sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.31.1.75
```
Replace 10.31.1.75 with your Swarm Manager IP address. 

Normal output contains "docker swarm join" command:
```
Swarm initialized: current node (efkok8n0eiy4f6xu48zaro3x8) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4okdpjkrwzocwgqor1o9r5ck0xah646emhtgf9d3t4f4n11jgn-5a9ms5okxyxzjmcbz09pc9ujq 10.31.1.75:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```
To enable swarm mode on Workers:
```
$ sudo docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4okdpjkrwzocwgqor1o9r5ck0xah646emhtgf9d3t4f4n11jgn-5a9ms5okxyxzjmcbz09pc9ujq 10.31.1.75:2377
```
Normally you should see:
```
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```

WARNING: In case of any error like: Error response from daemon: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = all SubConns are in TransientFailure, latest connection error: 
connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 10.31.1.172:2377: connect: no route to host"  Check for Iptables rules on the manager node.

NOTE: To disable the swarm mode `$ sudo docker swarm leave --force`

=== Starting MSA from the "Docker Swarm Manager" machine

1. `$ sudo docker node ls` to check if all nodes are connected and active. 
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart.git` clone git repository.
3. `$ cd ./quickstart/` to change directory.
4. `$ docker login` Docker login to access containers.
5. `$ sudo docker stack deploy --with-registry-auth -c docker-compose.ha.yml msa` to run installation.
6. Verify:
```
$ sudo docker stack services msa
