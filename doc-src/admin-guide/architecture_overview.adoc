The {product_name} is an Integrated Automation Platform, which consists of several components running on Docker containers.

== Overview of the platform
- The {product_name} API server: this server provides a REST API layer on top of all the functions, it also provides the Workflow Engine responsible for executing the automated processes
- The {product_name} core engine: this component, composed of several daemons is responsible for the configuration of the Managed Entities, the assurance and collecting the syslogs.
- A PostgreSQL database: the {product_name} stores its state in a PostgreSQL database.
- An Elasticsearch cluster: the {product_name} collects and stores the events and the alarms in an Elasticsearch server.
- A BPM engine based on Camunda, fully integrated with Workflow Engine.
- A Subversion based server to store the history of the configurations of the Managed Entities
- REST API and UI: To control the {product_name}, you can use either the web based interface or the REST API.
