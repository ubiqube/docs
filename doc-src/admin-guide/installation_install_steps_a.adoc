1. Check your Docker engine has access to DockerHub. You can, for instance, run `docker run hello-world` to test the access.
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart.git` to clone the GitHub repository on you computer.
3. `$ cd quickstart`
4. `git checkout tags/{revnumber} -b {revnumber}`
5. `$ sudo docker login` (check the note below)
6. `$ sudo docker-compose up -d` to create the mini lab composed of the {product_name} containers.

IMPORTANT: for `docker login`, use the Docker ID "msa2trial" and the link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/[access token] provided by your main point of contact at UBiqube.
