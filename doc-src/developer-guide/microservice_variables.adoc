Variable are usually defined to hold the parameters to be passed to the microservice. For instance, the port and IP to block for a firewall policy. Variables can also be used to display user information that is not meant to be used for configuring the managed entity.

Setting variables is done from the section "Variables" on the microservice editor screen.

When you create a new microservice, the variable object_id, which is mandatory, will be set and cannot be deleted. It can be edited to set it's type and other advanced properties.

All variables are referenced with the prefix `$param` which is automatically set in the variable editor screen and when a variable has to be referenced in one of the microservice function, you need to use the syntax `{$param.your_variable}` (see below for more examples)

By default the type of a variable is String but other types are supported such as Integer, Boolean, Password, IpAddress, ObjectRef,...

== Overview

The variables are usually defined to hold the parameters to be passed to the microservice. For instance, the port and IP to block for a firewall policy. Variables can also be used to display user information that is not meant to be used for configuring the managed entity.

Setting different type for variables will affect the way the microservice end user form for creating or updating it will render.

For instance, the type bolean will render the variable as true/false radio buttons.

== Types

.String
the default type for a variable. Accepts any value. User form renders as a input field without any specifc validation with regards to the value set.
