Variable are usually defined to hold the parameters to be passed to the microservice. For instance, the port and IP to block for a firewall policy. Variables can also be used to display user information that is not meant to be used for configuring the managed entity.

Setting variables is done from the section "Variables" on the microservice editor screen.

When you create a new microservice, the variable object_id, which is mandatory, will be set and cannot be deleted. It can be edited to set it's type and other advanced properties.

All variables are referenced with the prefix `$param` which is automatically set in the variable editor screen and when a variable has to be referenced in one of the microservice function, you need to use the syntax `{$param.your_variable}` (see below for more examples)

By default the type of a variable is String but other types are supported such as Integer, Boolean, Password, IpAddress, ObjectRef,...
