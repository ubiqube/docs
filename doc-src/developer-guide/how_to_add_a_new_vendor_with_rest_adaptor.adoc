The REST Generic adapter will let you quickly integrate a new managed entity with a REST based management API but you may want to also have the vendor name and entity model appear in the list of supported vendor instead of REST-Generic.

Doing so will allow you to filter the microservice and deployment setting based on the vendor name and model name. 
This will ease the organisation of your integration files.
