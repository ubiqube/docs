= How to create a new vendor based on the REST Generic existing adapter
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: images]
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

The REST Generic adapter will let you quickly integrate a new managed entity with a REST based management API but you may want to also have the vendor name and entity model both appear in the list of supported vendor instead of REST/Generic.

Doing so will allow you to filter the microservice and deployment setting based on the vendor name and model name. 

This will ease the organisation of your integration files.

== How to do it

Let's assume that you want to add  vendorA / modelX to the list of supported vendors.

You will need an access to the {product_name} CLI of the msa_dev container (see link:../admin-guide/architecture_overview{outfilesuffix}[architecture] for more details).

```
$ sudo docker-compose exec msa_dev bash
```

=== Create the new model in the Adapters github repository

If you followed the quickstart guide to install your instance of {product_name} the image msa_dev contains a clone of link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters[github.com/openmsa/Adapters]

We are going to create the new model in this local repository. Using a git repository has several advantages such as using a working branch to track your changes and revert them if needed or contributing to the community by creating a pull request to submit your code.

Go to the repository

```
# cd /opt/devops/OpenMSA_Adapters/
```

Go to the adapter definition directory and create a new folder for your new vendor model. 
By convention the folder name should be defined as <vendor name>_<model name>

```
# cd adapters
# mkdir -p vendorA_modelX/conf
# cd vendorA_modelX/conf
```

You need to create 2 configuration files to define this new model:

- device.properties : define the adapter properties for UI display (msa_ui)
- sms_router.conf : define the adapter config for the Core Engine (msa_sms)

NOTE: In the github repository you will find lot of link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters/blob/master/doc/[doc] and example about these files 

.device.properties
----
# VendorA / ModelX              <1>
manufacturer.id = 18082020      <2>
manufacturer.name = VendorA
model.id = 18082020             <3>
model.name = ModelX

obsolete = false
----
<1> any comment you find useful.
<2> select a unique, numeric ID. Your current date it a good choice.
<3> same as above.

NOTE: the model ID and the manufacturer ID don't have to be identical and you can have several models for the same vendor by using different model ID

.sms_router.conf
----
# VendorA / ModelX                  <1>
model       18082020:18082020       <2>
path        rest_generic            <3>
----
<1> any comment you find useful.
<2> format: <manufacturer.id>:<model.id>.
<3> the path to an existing adapter code (example: rest_generic).

=== Update file owner

```
chown -R ncuser.ncuser /opt/devops/OpenMSA_Adapters/adapters/vendorA_modelX
```

=== Install and activate the new vendor

Execute the CLI commands below

----
# cd /opt/devops/OpenMSA_Adapters/bin
# ./da_installer install /opt/devops/OpenMSA_Adapters/adapters/vendorA_modelX
----

Output:

----
update manufacturers_properties config for vendor VendorA [18082020].
>> update  /opt/ubi-jentreprise/generated/conf/device/custom/manufacturers.properties with 18082020,"VendorA",1
update models_properties config for vendor VendorA [18082020], model ModelX [18082020].
>> update  /opt/ubi-jentreprise/generated/conf/device/custom/models.properties with 18082020,18082020,"ModelX","H",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,U,0,0
update core_engine config for vendor VendorA [18082020], model ModelX [18082020], path vendorA_modelX.
----

Exit the docker container msa_dev and restart the API container and the CoreEngine service

----
$ sudo docker-compose restart msa_api
$ sudo docker-compose exec msa_sms /etc/init.d/ubi-sms restart
----

=== Verify your new vendor is available

Once the services have restart, you can connect to the UI to check that a new vendor/model is listed when you create a new managed entity.

image:adapter_new_vendorA_modelX.png[width=1000px]

First, verify that you can create a new managed entity and try to activate it.

During the activation, you can monitor the logs of smsd module from the Core Engine and check that the adapter code being used is the one from rest_generic (or any other you may have set in sms_router.conf above)

Login to the CoreEngine container  

----
$docker-compose exec msa_sms bash
----

Set the configuration log level to DEBUG

----
# tstsms SETLOGLEVEL 255 255
----

Monitor the logs with tail

----
# tail -F /opt/sms/logs/smsd.log 
----

It should output something similar to that. You can verify that the managed entity activation is relying on the adapter code specified in sms_router.conf
