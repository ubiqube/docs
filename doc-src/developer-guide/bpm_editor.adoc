Use your mouse to add tasks and link them together.

NOTE: A BPM process must have a StartEvent and an EndEvent.

NOTE: Only one executable BPM process can be designed at a time. 

You can save your BPM at anytime and edit it later. When you save you BPM, you need to select a sub-tenant.

NOTE: A BPM is associated to a single sub-tenant.

=== Design a BPM process

The {product_name} BPM engine supports the following BPMN elements:

image:images/bpm_start_event.png[] the first element of the BPM process.

image:images/bpm_end_event.png[] indicates the end of the BPM process.

image:images/bpm_task.png[] an executable task that can run workflow processes.

image:images/bpm_gateway_event.png[] an exclusive gateway.

NOTE: Support for more elements will be provided in future link../release_notes{outfilesuffix}[releases]

==== Exclusive gateway (XOR)

The XOR gateway will let you model a decision in the process.

When the execution arrives at this gateway, all outgoing sequence flows are evaluated in the order in which they have been defined. 
The sequence flow which condition evaluates to ‘true’ is selected for continuing the process.



=== Connecting workflows and processes

Select an executable task to see the list of workflows (based on the sub-tenant selected), then select a process and provide it's input parameters.
