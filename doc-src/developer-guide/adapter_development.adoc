The *adapters* are the "drivers" that allow the main {product_name}'s engine to seamlessly communicate with the Managed Entities for configuration assurance, event collection, et cetera.

== Overview

The Adapters are designed per vendor because they need to address the specifics of each vendor especially when the Managed Entitie does not provide a REST management API.

The {product_name} provides a library of device adaptors ready to use. 
The libraries are implemented in PHP which makes extension and customization easy.


== How to find, install, activate the adapters
The Adapters are packaged in the {product_name}, in the "api" container (see link:../admin-guide/architecture_overview{outfilesuffix}[Architecture] for more details).

Many other Adapters are available on the https://github.com/openmsa/Adaptors[Adaptor Github repository,window=_blank]

The installation of an Adapter is covered in this documentation: link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adaptors/blob/master/doc/How_to_install_a_new_adapter.md[How to install an Adapter,window=_blank]

[#rest_adapter]
== REST Generic adapter
The REST Generic adapter, available on link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adaptors/tree/master/adapters/rest_generic[Github,window=_blank] will allow you to integrate most vendors that exposes a REST management interface API.

This adapter is included in the mini lab (see link:../user-guide/quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Quickstart] for more details)

I you need to create a new vendor based on the REST Generic adapter, you can follow this guide: link:how_to_add_a_new_vendor_with_rest_adaptor{outfilesuffix}[How to add a new REST based vendor]

== Adapter SDK

The Adapter SDK is composed of a set of PHP scripts that implement an API
This API exposes functions such as:

. Asset management
. Status polling 
. SshConnection
. Provisioning
. Update conf
. Backup conf
. Microservice commands (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, IMPORT)
. …

=== Custom commands
It is possible to implement new custom commands that will be callable from the {product_name} API (verb JSACMD MY_COMMAND).

=== Status Polling

The {product_name}'s SecEngine daemon in charge of polling the device for availability is `polld`.

----
Logs: /opt/sms/logs/sms_polld.log
----

By default, polling is using `ping`, and for scalability and performance reasons the polling mechanism is implemented in the C programming language. 
This allows the {product_name} to poll several hundreds of managed entities per minute.
For the devices that don’t support `ping`, or in case the polling has to be customized, it is possible to implement a custom polling in a php script:
----
/opt/sms/bin/polld/<model>_polld.php
----

.Custom polling example:
On Stormshield the connection to the device is tested as shown below
[source, php]
----
try
{
  global $sms_sd_ctx;
  netasq_connect();
  netasq_disconnect();
}
catch (Exception $e)
{
  netasq_disconnect();
  return $e->getCode();
}
return SMS_OK;
----

=== Asset Management
The {product_name}'s SecEngine can connect on a managed entity to fetch a set of predefined assets such as:

. Firmware
. Memory
. CPU
. …

The specific model script retrieves information (via CLI, snmp, REST calls...) into an array. 
The array is then passed to a specific callback in order to store the information in the database.
[source, php]
----
sms_polld_set_asset_in_sd($sd_poll_elt, $asset);
----
.Custom Asset Management
It is also possible to extract custom assets. 
They will be stored in the database as a list of key values.

The asset mngt module uses regular expressions to extract the asset from the configuration.

These values are stored in a database that keeps the asset history.

The asset script is device specific and is located in:
----
/opt/sms/bin/polld/<model>_mgmt.php
----

.Example on Fortigate
Regexp:
[source, php]
----
$get_system_status_asset_patterns = array(
    'firmware'    => '@Version:\s+(?<firmware>.*)@',
    'av_version'  => '@Virus-DB:\s+(?<av_version>.*)@',
    'ips_version' => '@IPS-DB:\s+(?<ips_version>.*)@',
    'serial'      => '@Serial-Number:\s+(?<serial>.*)@',
    'license'     => '@License Status: (?<license>.*)@',
);
----
The regexp is executed against the result of the CLI : `get system status`.

.Example on Cisco
Regexp:

[source, php]
----
$show_ver_asset_patterns = array(
  'serial' => '@Processor board ID (?<serial>\S*)@',
  'license' => '@oftware \((?<license>[^\)]*)\)@',
  'firmware' => '@\), Version (?<firmware>[^,]*),@',
  'model' => '@^(?<model>[^(]*) \(.*with \d+K/\d+K bytes of memory@',
  'cpu' => '@^.* \((?<cpu>[^\)]*)\) processor@',
  'memory' => '@with (?<memory>\d*K/\d*K bytes) of memory@',
  );
----

The regexp is executed against the result of the CLI `show version`.

=== Configuration Management
==== Dialog with the Managed Entity
The following PHP scripts have to be created in the `/opt/sms/bin/php/<model>/` directory.

This set of PHP scripts manages the dialog between the {produt_name} and the managed entity.

.adaptor.php
Provides access to the device for device connection and configuration update.

.device_connect.php
Manages the connection to the device (SSH, or REST, for example).

==== Microservice based configuration
PHP scripts to configure a device using objects:

.<model>_command.php

Manages the OBMF specificities for the device.

.device_configuration.php
Manages the main configuration methods for the managed entity (only update_conf() is used for objects).

==== Template based configuration
PHP scripts to configure a device using templates:

.do_update_conf.php
Generates and applies a configuration.

This task is also called automatically when the router configuration changes.

.device_configuration.php
update_conf() should be enhanced to support configuration templates.

==== Provisioning
PHP scripts to do the initial provisioning of the device:

.do_provisioning.php
Generates and applies the initial configuration on the device.
This is an asynchronous task, so a script must be provided to give an update on progress.

.provisioning_stages.php
Describes all the provisioning stages. This is used to store the provisioning status into the database.

.prov_lock.php
Provisioning action to lock the database for this device during the provisioning.

.prov_init_conn.php
This is the initial connection test.

.prov_dns_update.php
Add the device to the MSA local DNS.

.prov_unlock.php
Provisioning action to unlock the database for this device during the provisioning.

==== Other Features
.do_get_running_conf.php
Called by GUI (menu Monitoring -> Get the running configuration).

.do_staging.php
Generate the staging configuration for the device (menu General -> Staging).

.do_backup_conf.php
Generate a backup of the device configuration.

.do_restore_conf.php
Restore a configuration backup on the device.

.do_update_firmware.php
Update the firmware of a device.

If a script is not present, the corresponding operation on the {product_name} will give the "Function not supported by the device" error.

=== Connectivity to the Devices
For the managed entities that expose a remote CLI based management interface the adapter API requires the implementation of a class that extends SshConnection.

SshConnection connection is defined in `/opt/sms/bin/php/smsd/ssh_connection.php`

SshConnection  extends GenericConnection defined in `/opt/sms/bin/php/smsd/generic_connection.php`

SshConnection  extends GenericConnection defined in `/opt/sms/bin/php/smsd/generic_connection.php`

image:adapter_class_hierachy.png[]

==== The class Connection 

./opt/sms/bin/php/smsd/connection.php 

This class is always overridden by a generic connection.
It defines functions such as the "get" and "set" attributes such as the prompt, the device IP (sd_ip_config) ...

The function `connect`
It defines the main connect functions `public function connect($connectString)`.

This function uses the PHP function `proc_open` to execute the connect command and opens file pointers for IO.
The disconnect closes the IO file pointers and leaves a clean state.

.Other function 
`sendexpectone` for sending a command to a device and getting the result back.

[source, php]
----
public function sendexpectone($origin, $cmd, $prompt='lire dans sdctx', $delay = EXPECT_DELAY, $display_error = true)
----

Example (in Fortinet adaptor)
[source, php]
----
$buffer = sendexpectone(__FILE__ . ':' . __LINE__, $this, 'get system status', '#');
----

==== The class GenericConnection 
./opt/sms/bin/php/smsd/connection.php
This class implements a constructor that initiates a class attribute.

Device information is read by calling the function `get_network_profile()`.

get_network_profile is defined for each device in a PHP file located in:
----
/opt/sms/spool/php_db_data/<device_id>.php
----
This PHP file is an “image” of the device configuration as stored in the database.

This design allows a quick and easy access to device configurations such as IP, credentials, interface name, SNMP community, customer ID ...

==== The class SshConnection

./opt/sms/bin/php/smsd/ssh_connection.php 

It implements the function `do_connect()` that uses the function `connect()` from the class Connection:

[source, php]
----
parent::connect("ssh –p 22 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no…
----

It uses the function `expect()` to check that SSH connectivity is OK (by checking that the result contains “Permanently added”).

==== The class SshKeyConnection 
./opt/sms/bin/php/smsd/ssh_connection.php 

Allows public/private keys via SSH authentication with the device.

.Example
Fortiweb WAF on AWS requires this kind of authentication.

===== Other examples
.LinuxGenericsshConnection
----
/opt/sms/bin/php/linux_generic/linux_generic_connect.php
----

Used in `do_update_conf.php`

[source, php]
----
$ret = linux_generic_connect();
----

=== Implementation of ‘Update Configuration’
Base operation for implementing:

. The initial provisioning
. The template-based configuration
. The Microservice CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE operation

Implemented by `do_update_conf.php`

Can be called directly by the {product_name}'s SecEngine API, it is an asynchronous process, its status can be monitored.

=== Managed Entity activation (initial provisioning)
The {product_name} executes a set of steps to activate the device.

The steps can be customized to do additional operations.

.Default steps:
Defined in `provisioning_stages.php`
[source, php]
----
$provisioning_stages = array(
0 => array('name' => 'Lock Provisioning',     'prog' => 'prov_lock'),
1 => array('name' => 'Initial Connection',    'prog' => 'prov_init_conn'),
2 => array('name' => 'Initial Configuration', 'prog' => 'prov_init_conf'),
3 => array('name' => 'DNS Update',            'prog' => 'prov_dns_update'),
4 => array('name' => 'Unlock Provisioning',   'prog' => 'prov_unlock'),
5 => array('name' => 'Save Configuration',    'prog' => 'prov_save_conf'),
)
----

=== Configuration backup/restore
.do_backup_conf.php 
Based on the verb GETSDCONF (see save_router_conf.sh) which is implemented by do_get_sd_conf.php for each device.

.do_restore_conf.php
The implementation will vary depending on the vendor.

.Example
Fortinet uses TFTP and CLI `execute restore config tftp`. Cisco ISR first tries to SCP to flash and to TFTP and then reboots.

=== Connectivity fallback mechanism
By default, the device adaptor uses secure protocols to communicate with the devices (SSH or TFTP).

When these protocols fail (the device doesn’t support them or firewall restrictions – which might be unlikely), there is a fallback mechanism to protocols such as Telnet or TFTP.

.Example
in `cisco_isr_connect.php`

=== Microservice implementation
The implementation of the functions CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE/IMPORT is specific to the vendor.

NOTE: this is especially true for the IMPORT.

CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE are using the functions to apply conf, this is similar to the configuration update.

IMPORT needs to be aware of the device configuration structure.

It is necessary to provide a unified GUI to build the import but with devices that have different data models.

NOTE: for REST based managed entities, the IMPORT is usually generic since the response is formatted in XML or JSON (cf. link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adaptors/tree/master/adapters/rest_generic[rest_generic])

== The {product_name}'s SecEngine API
As well as named verbs, these commands can be used to interact directly with the {product_name}'s SecEngine from the CLI.

The can also be executed with a REST API:

*HTTP Request:* `+/sms/verb/{verb}/{deviceId}+`

*Method:* `+POST+`
[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
| Parameter Name
| Type
| Description

| verb
| String
| the command (JSAPROVISIONING, JSCHECKPROVISIONING, JSAUPDATECONF,...)

| deviceId
| String
| the database ID of the managed entity

|===

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
| COMMAND
|
 
|JSAPROVISIONING
|Initial provisioning

|JSCHECKPROVISIONING
|Check initial provisioning status

|JSAUPDATECONF
|Update configuration

|JSSTAGING
|Staging

|JSGETSDCONF
|Get router running configuration

|JSGETCONF
|Get router generated 

|===

The verbs are associated to specific PHP do_<verb>.php:

.Example
----
tstsms JSGETSDCONF UBI132
----

This will retrieve the running configuration of the device and use the implementation of `do_get_running_conf.php`.

=== Operation status feedback
During operations done by the {product_name}'s SecEngine, especially the asynchronous ones, the status of the ongoing operation can be set for the user by the PHP scripts. How to update the status depends on the operation.

.Initial Provisioning
Set provisioning status for a provisioning stage.
[source, php]
----
sms_bd_set_provstatus($sms_csp, $sms_sd_info, $stage, $status, $ret, $next_status, $additionalmsg)
----

.Configuration Update
Set the update status of the configuration update of an equipment.
[source, php]
----
sms_set_status_update($sms_csp, $sdid, $error_code, $status, $e->getMessage())
----
