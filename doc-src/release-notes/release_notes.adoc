== Latest release 
The latest {product_name} release is {revnumber}. 

The convention works as follows: x.y.z (all representing numbers) and

x = major release (major upgrade of product), 

y = minor release (features, changes)

z = bug or security fixes

== Fixes

Various fixes have been made to the product to ensure its continued ability to empower users, ensure a smoother user experience and deliver the value that businesses need in today's environment while being ahead in terms of features, being evergreen and the agility of the {product_name} to grow.

=== Specific technical fixes

include::{includedir}/release_2.3.adoc[version 2.3]

include::{includedir}/release_2.1.adoc[version 2.1]

include::{includedir}/release_2.0.adoc[version 2.0]

== User experience (UX)

{product_name} introduces a completely new UX empowering the user with a holistic approach to managing a wide range of entities such as firewalls, UTMs, switches, etc. and also managing cloud infrastructure or physical data center assets.

The look and feel of the login page was improved to be more intuitive with navigation and to showcase the capabilities of {product_name}.

Logo designs have been smartly redesigned to have users know which product is being used, in addition to our company logo (Powered By UBiqube) being more prominent.  

Menu layouts reflect alignment to the product vision. Integration and Automation are now top levels of the tree selection on the left-hand side of the dashboard, making it more intuitive to developers of this product.

The functional duality of the {product_name} being an operation platform as well as a development framework provides two navigation environments to address both types of user:

- A developer-centric environment.
- A manager-centric environment.

The {product_name} UX structure is in line with our modular {product_name} architecture (microservices, workflows, etc.) for consistency and greater concept adoption.

The Developer User now features access to three editors which include Microservices, Workflows and BPM from the one screen.

This has allowed opening of all the screens for the Workflow Editor to be able to create processes, tasks and code.

== Enhancements

=== Automation: business process modeling (BPM)

The {product_name} Automation stack has been enriched with a business process modeling (BPM) visual workflow editor. 

With BPM, you can express reliable service orchestration, task flows, event handling and apply integrated automation principles through diagrams in more intuitive and visual manner.  This makes automation not only technically executable from the visual workflow editor, yet easy to understand for everyone.

The BPM is part of the Automation engine, which is tighly integrated with the {product_name}.

You can access the Workflows via REST API in order to start process instances, complete tasks and much more. 

TIP: Go to link:user-guide/bpm{outfilesuffix}[GUI overview] to get a detailed description of this new user interface.

=== Container based architecture

A container is essentially software that packages up code and all code dependencies so an application can run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another, abstracting the computer hardware. 

The {product_name} runs on a set of Docker containers. A Docker container image includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

The reason {product_name} is now containerized reflects not only a move in the industry itself, but it allows for much greater scalability and modular design than past iterations of the product.

== CoreEngine

No changes have been made to the core engine from previous versions of the product.  This allows consistency from branches of OpenMSA (community version).
