= Version 2.8
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: images]
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]


The focus of the 2.8.0 release of {product_name} is mainly about improving the performances and reliability. 

The microservice console has also been improved to provide a better user experience by allowing bulk changes of the microservice instances as well as additional design features. Advanced parameters have also been improved for a better support of the variables.

== Assurance

=== Download PDF Kibana dashboard

Kibana dashboard visible in the manager portal dashboard can be previewed and downloaded as a PFD file.

=== SNMPv3

KPI monitoring with SNMPv3 is now supported with  {product_name} version 2.8.3. More detail are available in the manager guide, assurance section.


== Repository

The {product_name} repository contains the definition files for the workflows, microservices, BPM and various datafiles.
Until version 2.8.3, these files could only be accessed either by the API or manually by connecting to the msa-dev container and using the CLI. 
These files are store under /opt/fmc_repository/

With version 2.8.3, you can use the UI to upload, delete, unzip and edit files in the DataFiles part of the repository. This feature is available for both developers and managers.

== Microservices

=== Duplicate an instance

Now you can select a instance of a microservice and duplicate it, you will see the same screen as "Add Row", but the difference is that the values are pre-filled.

=== Read: generate a custom preview of your configuration

You can now implement the "Read" function of a microservice with a Smarty PHP template and use the new "Read" button to generate a preview of the microservice instance as stored in the database.

image:2.8_microservice_read.png[width=700px]

This can be useful to generate a preview of the configuration to push to the managed entity. 

Just like the other microservice functions such as Create, Update and Delete, the Read is implemented as a template. This gives you the possibility to generate any format like simple key/value, JSON, XML,...

=== Bulk operation

Microservice bulk operations allow you create/update and delete several instance of a microservice. 

image:2.8_microservice_bulk_operation.png[width=700px]

With "Primary Composite Key", the new variable advanced parameter, you can bulk create microservice and specify unique values for the variables.

NOTE: microservice bulk operation can be turned on/off (default is off) by changing the feature flag FEATURE_MICROSERVICE_BULK_OPERATION in the docker-compose YAML file.

=== Split view

Use the microservice console horizontal split view to display and work on the instances of 2 microservices.

image:2.8_microservice_split_view.png[width=700px]

== xBAC and admin

=== Audit logs source IP

The source IP address of any {product_name} API call, including from the UI, is now listed in the audit logs available in the user profile.

image:2.8_auditlog_src_ip.png[width=700px]

=== Fine control the microservice and managed entity visibility 

The permission profile has been enhanced to allow a more precise control on the visibility of the microservice and the managed.

It is possible to set some permission filtering tags for both managed entities and/or microservices.

image:2.8_me_ms_tag_permission_profile.png[width=700px]

These tags will be used to control the user visibility.

image:2.8_me_ms_tag_managed_entity.png[width=700px]

NOTE: label based microservice and managed entity control turned on/off (default is off) by changing the feature flag FEATURE_PERMISSION_PROFILE_LABELS in the docker-compose YAML file.

=== Workflow

==== New variable type "Code"

A new variable type "Code" is now available and will be rendered as a text field. Syntax highlighting can be configured as advanced variable parameter.

image:2.8_workflow_var_type_code.png[width=700px]

== Portal theme

In the local settings, choose the dark or the new light theme.

image:2.8_ui_theme.png[width=700px]

=== CoreEngine

No changes have been made to the core engine from previous versions of the product. This allows consistency from branches of {openmsa_name} (community version), found on GitHub: https://github.com/openmsa

== New Libraries Available

=== Adapters

link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters/tree/master/adapters/arista_eos[Network/Arista/EOS]: design microservice and manage the latest version of Arista IOS.

link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters/tree/master/adapters/inventory_management[Application/Inventory/Management,window=_blank]: leverage the design and use of microservices locally managing data to the {product_name} database without the of a real device.

link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters/blob/master/adapters/cisco_ios_xr[Network/Cisco/IOS-XR]: design microservice and manage the latest version of Cisco IOS-XR.

== Upgrading

Instructions to upgrade available in the quickstart UIde.

=== Specific instructions for upgrading from {revnumber-prev} to {revnumber}

The quickstart provides an upgrade script `upgrade.sh` for taking care of possible actions such as recreating some volume, executing some database specific updates,...

In order to upgrade to the latest version, you need to follow these steps:

1. `cd quickstart`
2. `git checkout master`
3. `git pull`
4. `./scripts/install.sh`
