Welcome to release 3.1.0 of the {product_name}. There are many updates in this version that we hope you'll like !

== User experience

=== License Management

The License Management feature allows organizations to manage their {product_name} licenses more effectively. 
It provides a centralized interface for viewing license details and renewing or updating licenses as needed.

A pop-up warning is displayed when the license is about to expire, and another warning is displayed when the license has expired and the grace period has ended.

== Workflows

=== Role-Based Access Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that restricts access to resources based on the roles assigned to users. It enables organizations to define granular permissions for different users, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data or perform specific actions.

Role-Based Access Control is now integrated in the {product_name} architecture to provide fine-grained access control for workflows.

Role can be assigned to users and groups, and permissions can be defined at the process level, allowing organizations to control who can view, edit, or execute workflows.

== Architecture

=== K8 Optimized Architecture

A new github.com/ubiqube/msa-kubernetes repository is created to store the {product_name} Kubernetes helm chart which can be used to deploy {product_name} on any Kubernetes cluster.  

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It enables teams to build resilient, scalable systems by abstracting infrastructure complexities and providing features like service discovery, self-healing, load balancing, and automated rollouts. 

With Kubernetes, organizations can achieve efficient resource utilization and seamless application orchestration across diverse environments, from on-premises data centers to cloud-based platforms.

=== KPI Monitoring

==== Message broker / ActiveMQ Artemis

ActiveMQ Artemis is a message broker that supports the JMS 2.0 API. It is a high-performance, non-blocking, reactive messaging system that enables real-time communication between applications. 

ActiveMQ Artemis is designed to be lightweight and scalable, making it an ideal choice for microservices architectures.

ActiveMQ Artemis is now integrated in the {product_name} architecture to provide a reliable and efficient messaging system for communication between the various components of the platform.

==== MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is designed to be flexible, scalable, and high-performance. It is a document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents, making it easy to work with data in a natural way.

MongoDB is now integrated in the {product_name} architecture to provide a scalable and efficient database for storing monitoring data.
