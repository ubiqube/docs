Welcome to the 2.8.8 release of the {product_name}. There are many updates in this version that we hope you'll like !

== Assurance

=== Dashboard managed entities status

The global status of the managed entities is now visible in the dashboard. 

The status is expressed both as the number of managed entities and the percentage of the total. The values are calculated based on the tenant and subtenant selected.

=== Import/Export monitoring profile

You can export a monitoring profile and download it as a JSON formatted file and import it to another subtenant in the same {product_name} or another one.

This will help you reusing existing monitoring profile. As building a monitoring profile may requires a long process of identifying the SNMP OID, you can now rely on this feature to speed up your KPI monitoring coverage.
