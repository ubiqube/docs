= Version 2.3
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: images]
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

Various fixes have been made to the product to ensure its continued ability to empower users, ensure a smoother user experience and deliver the value that businesses need in today's environment while being ahead in terms of features, being evergreen and the agility of the {product_name} to grow.

== New features

The following feature improvements are included with this release:

=== Customizable dashboard

By default the manager dashboard displays the most important data to help you keep an eye on the status of your infrastructure. As your infrastructure evolves, so will your priorities and you may need to focus on some specific parts of your system while still being able to see the big picture.

To address this requirement, you can now choose the important data you want to see as a manager in your dashboard. For instance, make the topology part of your landing page, or select a managed entity and see it's KPI right away. You can also decide to assign dedicated views to your users so they can focus on their parts: monitoring, automation, integration.

=== BPM

==== Integrated look and feel

The styling of the BPM interface has been completely revamped. This new styling reflects the rest of the MSActivator interface, to give a consistent user experience. 

The editing of BPM parameters is now consistent with the editing of Workflow parameters. New background faded coloring, “electric” gradient borders, and icons have been added to the BPM execution console to improve the user experience. 

In addition, it is easy for the user to navigate between “Show Tasks” on previous tasks, or “Continue” on paused ones. A clipboard icon has been added to enable the user to copy task output to their clipboard, which is especially useful when you need to copy large blocks of task output.

==== BPMN 2.0

An extended support for BPMN 2.0 will allow you to model your most complex business processes.

image:bpm.png[width=700px]

===== Decision gateway

Allow your BPM process to make smart decisions based on the result of executed workflow and control the overall flow of the business process execution.

NOTE: if you are using a BPM created with {product_name}-2.2 that has some decision gateways, then you need to edit it, reset the gateway conditions and save before you can run it with {product_name}-2.3

===== Parallel gateway

In a complex business process, very often activities can be carried out in parallel and one activity may depend on others. To address this, you can use a parallel gateway.

===== User breakpoint

Some activities may require a human action to be carried out, like verifying the current state of the infrastructure being updated. It is also possible that during the design phase of your BPM process you need to set some breakpoints in order to better understand how your workflows are behaving and to debug then.

You can use the user breakpoint for that.

==== Full BPM history

The full history of BPM executions is now retained, which is completely consistent with the Workflow history management in version 2.2.

=== Workflows

==== Workflows scheduler

Managers can now benefit from the scheduled execution of the workflow processes and fully automate the management of infrastructure. 

Scheduled Workflows allow a process execution to be scheduled to run at a certain point in time: once, every minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly. 

The Workflow developer can decide whether to enable this feature or not, via the Workflow editor.

==== Advanced settings

The {product_name} workflow designer comes with a new set of variable types.

- Composite: advanced dynamic UI rendering with variable type composite: allow some dynamic end user form rendering at runtime.
- Password: auto-renders as a password web form input field.
- Link: auto-renders as a URL.

=== Microservices

The microservice designer now provides a new set of variable type such as

//- Composite: advanced dynamic UI rendering with variable type composite: allow some dynamic end user form rendering at runtime.
- Password: auto-renders as a password web form input field.
- Link: auto-renders as a URL.

=== Git integration

Developers love Git, so UBiqube has enabled Git integration in the Developer Dashboard. 

This means that as a developer, once they configure their {product_name} to connect to their Git repositories, the following code changes will automatically sync with those Git repositories: BPM, Workflows, Microservices.

=== Assurance

Assurance protects against and manages risk. This release provides the ability to monitor your KPI by polling them with SNMP or by collecting SNMP traps. 

You can create and manage alarms based on events collected from the network or created internally. You can also create an alarm based on KPI threshold crossing.  

This will enable you to better manage risk and determine best courses of action, based on the data. 

==== Custom monitoring profile

The {product_name} provides a complete suite of assurance modules from KPI monitoring to alarm management and dashboards. Closed loop assurance is possible as every components of the {product_name} are fully integrated. With the monitoring profile you can do the following:
 
- Configure and monitor your custom KPI with threshold crossing based alarms.
- Design and display your own monitoring graphs and decide what you want your end users to see in their homepage dashboards.

Configure alarm based on your KPI predefined thresholds and send email notification , SNMP traps or even execute workflow processes to automate remediation.

==== Integrated Kibana dashboards

For those {product_name} users that are experienced ELK-stack users, we are now including the link:https://www.elastic.co/kibana[Kibana] dashboard as a dedicated Docker container with {product_name} 2.3. 

This will give the manager full access to all of the {product_name} indexes, including audit and syslogs, to run their reports. In future versions of {product_name}, {ubiqube} will make this Kibana integration tighter within our management dashboard.

image:kibana_dashboard.png[width=700px]

=== User management

==== Permission profile

As an extension of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in {product_name}, the admin user can now design Permission Profiles. These profiles can be then applied to other users, and provide a finer granularity around what exact actions those users can do. 

image:permission_profile.png[width=700px]

NOTE: version 2.3 permission support is limited to create and delete managed entities and the feature is disabled by default. To enable it, edit the docker-compose file and set FEATURE_PERMISSION_PROFILES to true for the container msa_ui


==== User Audit Log (pre-RPA)

The new Audit Log records each action, or {product_name} REST API call, that a user makes after logging in to the dashboard. 

That data is stored in a dedicated index in our big data engine (Elasticsearch). The {product_name} admin user can search the audit log for any user, including applying date range filters. 

NOTE: in version 2.3, only write/delete actions are logged, but this coverage will be expanded in future releases.

== CoreEngine

No changes have been made to the core engine from previous versions of the product. This allows consistency from branches of OpenMSA (community version), found on GitHub: https://github.com/openmsa


== New Libraries Available

=== Adapters

KubernetesGeneric link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters/tree/master/adapters/kubernetes_generic[here]

- Method to parse content_type 'text/plain' for Pods logs added
- GET/POST methods improved

K8S_CLI link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters/tree/master/adapters/linux_k8_cli[here]

- K8S_CLI model added (based on LINUX_GENERIC) to execute Kubectl commands for a corresponding Device type

The full list of adapters included in 2.3 is available link:https://ubiqube.com/wp-content/docs/latest/user-guide/libraries_packages.html[here].

== Upgrading

Instructions to upgrade available in the quickstart guide.

=== Specific instruction for upgrading from {revnumber-prev} to {revnumber}

Starting from version 2.2.0, the quickstart provides an upgrade script `upgrade.sh` for taking care of possible actions such as recreating some volume, executing some database specific updates,...

Let's say that you are running {product_name} version {revnumber-prev}, to upgrade to the version {revnumber}, you need to follow these steps:

1. `$ cd quickstart`
2. `$ git checkout master`
3. `$ git pull`
4. `$ git checkout tags/{revnumber} -b {revnumber}`
5. `$ ./scripts/upgrade.sh`
