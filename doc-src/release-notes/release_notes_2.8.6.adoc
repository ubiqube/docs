Filtering and searching is available and clicking on the managed entity name in the alarms list will directly open the managed entity home page.

The default infrastructure component now provides direct navigation from the list on managed entities filtered by the status selected for the navigation.

An alarm bell icon has also been added to directly navigate to the main alarm screen.
