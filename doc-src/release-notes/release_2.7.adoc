=== Specific instructions for upgrading from {revnumber-prev} to {revnumber}

Starting from version 2.2.0, the quickstart provides an upgrade script `upgrade.sh` for taking care of possible actions such as recreating some volume, executing some database specific updates,...

Let's say that you are running {product_name} version {revnumber-prev}, to upgrade to the version {revnumber}, you need to follow these steps:

1. `cd quickstart`
2. `git checkout master`
3. `git fetch --unshallow`
4. `git pull`
5. `./scripts/install.sh`

=== only from 2.4.x or earlier

1. `docker-compose exec msa_front /bin/sh -c 'chown -R nginx:nginx /etc/ssl'`
