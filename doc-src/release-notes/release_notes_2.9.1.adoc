== Assurance

=== Automatically raise alarm for SNMP traps

An alarm is automatically raised upon reception of an SNMP traps. Whenever these is an SNMP trap collected, an alarm is raised. When the alarm is created, the MIB is used to extract the detail of the event based on SNMP walk and an alarm is created in ES/UI with the alarm name based on MIB/OID. The user is able to select an alarm and configure the target severity (promote/demote).

=== Automatically translate SNMP OID to human readable text

Upload your MIB files in the repository and let the CoreEngine translate the OID of the SNMP collected traps to human readable text.

=== Update alarms status flow: ack and clear status

With the addition of the alarm clearing action the alarm flow is now as follow:

*	clear=false, ack=false initial state
*	clear=false, ack=true : someone is aware
*	clear=true,  ack=false : people not aware BUT alarm was cleared (manually or automatically)
*	clear=true,  ack=true : people are aware AND alarm was cleared (manually or automatically)
