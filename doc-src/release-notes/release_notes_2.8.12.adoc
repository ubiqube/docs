== Assurance

== Governance
=== New permissions
Inside a permission profile, there is new capabilities to control the display. A new “Hide” right has been introduced, to keep elements visible by default, in some sections : repository, assurance, integration, profile and automation. Additionally, new categories have been created :
- Global search, to control the search button on the right corner
- Menu items, to choose to display main left menus
- Logout, to hide or show the logout button, useful in some Single Sign-On use-case

== Automation
=== Import only once
For large configuration, like thousand entries, a new option has been introduced in the micro services. To avoid a long synchronization, the import operation can be triggered only the first time. A checkbox is available in the Information tab of each micro services to activate this feature.
