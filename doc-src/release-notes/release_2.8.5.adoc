The focus of the 2.8.0 release of {product_name} is mainly about improving the performances and reliability. 

The microservice console has also been improved to provide a better user experience by allowing bulk changes of the microservice instances as well as additional design features. Advanced parameters have also been improved for a better support of the variables.

== Microservices

=== Support for JSON

The introduction of full support of JSON when designing and executing the REST API microservice synchronization is a major feature as it will ease the development of new microservices without having to rely on XML XPath to write the parsers for the JSON response coming from the vendor management REST API.

JSON microservices rely on JSONPath on the CoreEngine for executing the IMPORT parser to pull the data from the REST API response.
