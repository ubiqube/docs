{product_name} 2.8.5 includes several new features and a couple of bugs fixes.

With this release, users can create alarms with multiple subtenants and Managed Entities attached. 
Also, {product_name} can refresh logs automatically at custom defined frequency. In addition, users can search logs with advanced query syntax. 

Kibana has been upgraded to 7.14.2. 

{product_name} can be integrated with LDAP with more custom defined user's LDAP authentication. 

With this release, users can experience better file/repository management e.g., upload a file in any folder anywhere, folder names are displayed as subtenant names for better navigation. 

Users can enable or disable maintenance mode on managed entities. 

Several bugs are fixed which collectively improve workflows and microservices management and performance e.g., only edited microservices will be synchronized, workflow editor shows warning of unsaved changes, workflows visibility control based on users role, etc.

== Microservices

=== Support for JSON

The introduction of full support of JSON when designing and executing the REST API microservice synchronization is a major feature as it will ease the development of new microservices without having to rely on XML XPath to write the parsers for the JSON response coming from the vendor management REST API.

JSON microservices rely on JSONPath on the CoreEngine for executing the IMPORT parser to pull the data from the REST API response.

== Managed Entities

=== Maintenance mode

Users can enable or disable maintenance mode on managed entities.

During the maintenance mode, monitoring and alarm are paused and will resume when maintenance mode is turn off.

Events are generated when maintenance mode is turn on and off, allowing the managers to be notified by alarms.
