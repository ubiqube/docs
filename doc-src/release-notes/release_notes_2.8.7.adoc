=== Alarm severity control

Alarm severity control allows you to select the severity of the alarm when the matching event is detected and have a better control over you SLA.

By tuning the severity you can see similar alarms but with various severity

=== Alarm SNMP trap control

Sending an SNMP trap when an alarm is raised used to be the default behavior provided that you have configured the settings with the list of server IP addresses where SNMP traps will be sent.

In the new version 2.8.7, SNMP traps will only be sent when enable in the alarm rule.
