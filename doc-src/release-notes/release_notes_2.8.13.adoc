Welcome to the 2.8.13 release of the {product_name}. There are many updates in this version that we hope you'll like !

== User experience
=== Session expiration
Introducing new pop up message which inform the user about the minutes left before being discunnected. 
By default, for any users of the platform, 5 minutes before session expiration, a notification is displayed.
The session expiration time is fully configurable using our system variables. 

* Feature flag to control this beahvior : *FEATURE_SESSION_EXPIRATION_WARNING* (false by default)
* MSA variable to set expiration time : *Authentication token expiration time*

== Assurance
===	Flat vs Grouped mode
A user of the platform, when consulting logs can choose between two modes : flat or grouped. Flat, the native mode, allows to display logs sort by date, ascending or descending. With Grouped, the result will be bundled by fields, with date as the initial field. The user can choose extra fields to complete the result or sort logs by others criterias to form pack of results.

=== Logs search features

New functions have been added around logs search. 

==== Default time range

When clicking inside Search Logs field,  a list give all available fields as suggestion in input search. Additionally, logs are retrieved with a time range of 24h before to 24h after the current time by default. A user can still select a different start and end date using the filter by list. In the same area, the time range inclusion permits to include (within) or exclude (outside)  logs based and the chosen dates.

In the details view, use the plus icon to

=== Log rotation

In a multiple nodes architecture, old container logs are cleaned to save space on the host disk. New clean operations are scheduled automatically to optimize the platform.

=== Download feature at infrastructure level
Same as the subtenant level, logs can be downloaded using the download report button. 
A CSV file is generated containing same data as the screen is presenting.
