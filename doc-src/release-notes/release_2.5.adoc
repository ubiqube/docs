With this latest release, every aspect of MSActivator has been designed to maximize developer productivity. Together, intelligent coding assistance and ergonomic
design make development not only productive but also enjoyable.

Advance code and BPM generation enable the user to auto-generate Workflow code based on any existing Microservice, then automatically extract Workflow
variables from that Microservice, and finally have that Workflow automatically included in our new Intent-based Automation feature, which is powered by AI.

Put simply, we have reduced the amount of manual coding required for a developer in all steps of the design process, in some cases to zero.

In addition, we continue to make the development experience easier by including a Log tab on the Workflow view to see the debug messages for that Workflow,
and we have included a “Try Task” feature on the Workflow editor to enable developers to execute a single task for testing purposes.

For managers, we have enhanced the Topology context menu and added in new views for editing the configuration of MSActivator itself online.

== New Manager Features

=== Two Categories of Automation

There are now two categories of Automation on the main navigation menu, *Input-based* and *Intent-based*.

By default, Intent-based is deactivated. To enable it, edit your docker-compose.yml file and set `FEATURE_AI_ML` to true.

==== Input-based

In this screen, the user will find the Workflows and BPMs as in previous versions of MSActivator. If you are familiar with previous versions, nothing major has changed here.

==== Intent-based

In this screen, the user will find the new AI-powered interface for generating BPMs automatically, based upon the user choosing their desired final state
from the final states available. Note to use this feature properly, the developer user needs to define the States and Actions of the model via the “Intent-based” section of the Developer dashboard, see further details below in the “Intent-based Automation” section.

=== MSActivator Configuration View

While logged in as the super-user, the user can now change MSActivator settings, namely those settings for the MSActivator instance itself, in the new “MSA Variables” section found on the “Settings” screen.

If any additional steps are required for any of those global settings, for example container restarts, those steps will be provided in the same screen
the user uses to edit the values.

There is also a “Local” tab, in which you can find optional settings for the MSActivator UI. It is fine to leave these with the default settings, however,
MSActivator super-users now have the ability to tweak these settings if required.

image:2.5_local_settings.png[width=700px]


=== Topology Context Menu Enhancements

The right-click context menu on the Topology screen has now been enhanced, to include a number of new options for Managed Entities such as:

- Activate / Activate without connection
- Edit / Delete / Details

In addition, now when you trigger a Workflow or BPM by right-clicking on a Managed Entity in the Topology, note the internal ID of the Managed Entity
clicked upon is now passed to the Workflow or BPM invoked.

=== New Default Kibana Dashboard

Using MSActivator, any dashboard configured in your Kibana deployment can be integrated and displayed on the Management screen. By default, we
include the following traffic_overview dashboard for you to display as an example Kibana integration that works out of the box.

=== Workflow Execution Console Logs

We have added a new log tab to the process execution console. As the workflow process is running, the user can click on that "Logs" tab to see
the log entries for this execution live.

== New Developer Features

=== BPM

==== Decision Gateway Extension

The conditions of a definition gateway can now depend either on the result status of the execution of a workflow or on the value of a workflow variable.

image:2.5_BPM_decision_gateway.png[width=700px]

==== Workflow Parameter Control

When designing or executing a BPM, you can now control how the workflow parameters are passed to the executed process.

You have 3 possible options: "Saved", "Latest" and "Pass" in the workflow parameter section of a BPM workflow container definition.

- Saved: will allow you to define the parameter values and these values will be passed to the workflow process execution.
- Latest: will use the values stored in the workflow instance context. 
- Pass: will allow you to use the values from another workflow referenced by the BPM.

==== BPM Looping

MSActivator now supports looping flows in the BPM, which is a fix from the previous release.

=== Forgot Password

On the login screen, a “Forgot password” feature has been added, which enables the user to recover their MSActivator account in the event of a forgotten password. Once clicked, the user will be prompted to enter their email address, and a recovery email will be sent to that inbox.

=== Workflow

==== Task Execution Tester

When developing a workflow, you can now execute a single task without having to execute the whole process.

image:2.5_WF_task_tester.png[width=700px]

==== Code Completion

A common feature in code editors is auto code completion, where the code editor is smart enough to guess what object or function you might want to access next, and automatically suggest those to you.

Our code editor is able to do this now as it is aware of our proprietary SDK classes and methods.

image:2.5_WF_code_completion.png[width=700px]

==== Whitespace Highlighting

The Workflow code editor now highlights whitespace, such as spaces, tabs, and line returns.  

This is particularly important for Python users, as that language is whitespace sensitive.

image:2.5_WF_whitespace_highlight.png[width=700px]

==== Code Panel Maximization

We have added this new button on the top right of the code editor to maximize the size of the code panel in the Workflow editor, to give developers more screen space to see their code.

image:2.5_WF_code_panel_max.png[width=700px]

==== Keyboard Shortcuts

There are a list of keyboard shortcuts that our Workflow code editor supports.  

We have now started to document these in a new panel, which is accessible via a new "i" icon in the editor itself.

image:2.5_WF_editor_shortcuts.png[width=700px]

=== Intent-based Automation

As the developer, the user can now auto-generate BPMs to interact with their environment, based upon an AI algorithmic model. The model is a combination
of States, and Actions that are mapped to those States. In the Developer view, the user can design these States and Actions to build up that model. Once populated, any user can then auto-generate BPMs by simply choosing their Initial state (the current state of their environment) and their Final state (the desired final state, i.e. their intent). Once those options are selected, the system will generate a BPM via the “Generate BPM” button for the user to review, that will contain the required Workflows to handle the state transitions.


The BPM generated will then simply become part of the BPM library for the MSActivator instance, and anyone can edit or execute that BPM in the usual ways.

== Additional Changes

Our internal integration engine will now check the JSON passed to it by Workflows or from other sources, therefore it is important to pass clean parameters to the Microservices you are invoking. If you have an existing Workflow in MSActivator 2.4 that fails to work first time in 2.5 after upgrade, please firstly check to
ensure that the JSON parameters being passed by your Workflow to any Microservices underneath is valid.
For invalid calls, you will now see responses like these:

- Bad parameters on command: Bad format of JSON parameters, should be an array
- Bad parameters on command: Missing the mandatory variable in JSON parameters

If you see those, you need to check and correct your Workflow code.

== CoreEngine

No changes have been made to the core engine from previous versions of the product. This allows consistency from branches of OpenMSA (community version), found on GitHub: https://github.com/openmsa

== New Libraries Available

=== Adapters

== Upgrading

Instructions to upgrade available in the quickstart guide.

=== Specific instructions for upgrading from {revnumber-prev} to {revnumber}

Starting from version 2.2.0, the quickstart provides an upgrade script `upgrade.sh` for taking care of possible actions such as recreating some volume, executing some database specific updates,...

Let's say that you are running {product_name} version {revnumber-prev}, to upgrade to the version {revnumber}, you need to follow these steps:

1. `cd quickstart`
2. `git checkout master`
3. `git fetch --unshallow`
4. `git pull`
5. `./scripts/install.sh`
