Various fixes have been made to the product to ensure its continued ability to empower users, ensure a smoother user experience and deliver the value that businesses need in today's environment while being ahead in terms of features, being evergreen and the agility of the {product_name} to grow.

== New features

The following feature improvements are included with this release:

=== Custom Manager Dashboard

By default the manager dashboard displays the most important data to help you keep an eye on the status of your infrastructure. As your infrastructure evolves, so will your priorities and you may need to focus on some specific parts of your system while still being able to see the big picture.

To address this requirement, you can now choose the important data you want to see as a manager in your dashboard. For instance, make the topology part of your landing page, or select a managed entity and see it's KPI right away. You can also decide to assign dedicated views to your users so they can focus on their parts: monitoring, automation, integration.

=== BPM

The {product_name} BPM designer and execution console come with a new look and feel as well as an extended set of new features.

An extended support for BPMN 2.0 will allow you to model your most complex business processes.

==== Decision gateway

Allow your BPM process to make smart decisions based on the result of executed workflow and control the overall flow of the business process execution.

==== Parallel gateway

In a complex business process, very often activities can be carried out in parallel and one activity may depend on others. To address this, you can use a parallel gateway.

==== User breakpoint

Some activities may require a human action to be carried out, like verifying the current state of the infrastructure being updated. It is also possible that during the design phase of your BPM process you need to set some breakpoints in order to better understand how your workflows are behaving and to debug then.

You can use the user breakpoint for that.

==== Reusability and execution management

BPM management is now similar to workflow and microservice management: design one and associate it to subtenants and run it from a subtenant.

Each BPM execution creates a new BPM instance that you can manage separately.

=== Workflows

As manager, you can now benefit from the scheduled execution of your workflow processes and fully automate the management of your infrastructure.

The {product_name} workflow designer comes with a new set of variable types.

- Composite: advanced dynamic UI rendering with variable type composite: allow some dynamic end user form rendering at runtime.
- Password: auto-renders as a password web form input field.
- Link: auto-renders as a URL.

=== Microservices

The microservice designer now provides a new set of variable type such as

- Composite: advanced dynamic UI rendering with variable type composite: allow some dynamic end user form rendering at runtime.
- Password: auto-renders as a password web form input field.
- Link: auto-renders as a URL.

=== DevOps

Support for automated synchronization with a remote git repository for microservices, workflows and BPM.

=== Assurance

Assurance protects against and manages risk. This release provides the ability to monitor your KPI by polling them with SNMP or by collecting SNMP traps. 

You can create and manage alarms based on events collected from the network or created internally. You can also create an alarm based on KPI threshold crossing.  

This will enable you to better manage risk and determine best courses of action, based on the data. 

==== Monitoring Profile

The {product_name} provides a complete suite of assurance modules from KPI monitoring to alarm management and dashboards. Closed loop assurance is possible as every components of the {product_name} are fully integrated. With the monitoring profile you can do the following:
 
- Configure and monitor your custom KPI with threshold crossing based alarms.
- Design and display your own monitoring graphs and decide what you want your end users to see in their homepage dashboards.
Configure alarm based on your KPI predefined thresholds and send email notification , SNMP traps or even execute workflow processes to automate remediation.

==== Integrated Kibana dashboards

link:https://www.elastic.co/kibana[Kibana] is now included in the {product_name}. Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.

Design your Kibana visualization and dashboard to provide a comprehensive view over your infrastructure event and data flow.

=== User management

==== Permission profile

Create permission profiles to control user access rights and delegate action such as creating or deleting a managed entity to a manager.

image:permission_profile.png[width=700px]

NOTE: version 2.3 permission support is limited to create and delete managed entities and the feature is disabled by default. To enable it, edit the docker-compose file and set FEATURE_PERMISSION_PROFILES to true for the container msa_ui


==== Audit record

Every {product_name} user actions are recorded in an audit log for later auditing and reporting.

== CoreEngine

No changes have been made to the core engine from previous versions of the product. This allows consistency from branches of OpenMSA (community version), found on GitHub: https://github.com/openmsa

== Upgrading

Instructions to upgrade available in the quickstart guide.

=== Specific instruction for upgrading from {revnumber-prev} to {revnumber}

Starting from version 2.2.0, the quickstart provides an upgrade script `upgrade.sh` for taking care of possible actions such as recreating some volume, executing some database specific updates,...

Let's say that you are running {product_name} version {revnumber-prev}, to upgrade to the version {revnumber}, you need to follow these steps:

1. `$ cd quickstart`
2. `$ git checkout master`
3. `$ git pull`
4. `$ git checkout tags/{revnumber} -b {revnumber}`
5. `$ ./scripts/upgrade.sh`
