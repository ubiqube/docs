The focus of the 2.8.0 release of {product_name} is mainly about improving the performances and reliability. 

The Microservice console has also been improved to provide a better user experience by allowing bulk changes of the microservice instances as well as additional design features. Advanced parameters have also been improved for a better support of the variables.

== Microservices

=== Duplicate an instance

Now you can select a instance of a microservice and duplicate it, you will see the same screen as "Add Row", but the difference is that the values are pre-filled.

=== Read: generate a custom preview of your configuration

You can now implement the "Read" function of a microservice with a Smarty PHP template and use the new "Read" button to generate a preview of the microservice instance as stored in the database.

This can be useful to generate a preview of the configuration to push to the managed entity. 

Just like the other microservice functions such as Create, Update and Delete, the Read is implemented as a template. This gives you the possibility to generate any format like simple key/value, JSON, XML,...

=== Bulk operation

Microservice bulk operations allow you create/update and delete several instance of a microservice.

With "Primary Composite Key", the new variable advanced parameter, you can bulk create microservice and specify unique values for the variables.

NOTE: microservice bulk operation can be turned on/off by changing the feature flag FEATURE_MICROSERVICE_BULK_OPERATION in the docker-compose YAML file.

=== Split view

Use the microservice console horizontal split view to display and work on the instances of 2 microservices.

== xBAC

=== Fine control the microservice and managed entity visibility 

The permission profile has been enhanced to allow a more precise control on the visibility of the microservice and the managed.

It is possible to set some permission filtering tags for both managed entities and/or microservices.

These tags will be used to control the user visibility.

== Portal theme

In the local settings, choose the dark or the new light theme.

== CoreEngine

No changes have been made to the core engine from previous versions of the product. This allows consistency from branches of {openmsa_name} (community version), found on GitHub: https://github.com/openmsa

== New Libraries Available

=== Adapters

link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters/tree/master/adapters/arista_eos[Network/Arista/EOS]: design microservice and manage the latest version of Arista IOS.

link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters/tree/master/adapters/inventory_management[Application/Inventory/Management,window=_blank]: leverage the design and use of microservices locally managing data to the {product_name} database without the of a real device.

link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adapters/blob/master/adapters/cisco_ios_xr[Network/Cisco/IOS-XR]: design microservice and manage the latest version of Cisco IOS-XR.

== Upgrading

Instructions to upgrade available in the quickstart guide.

=== Specific instructions for upgrading from {revnumber-prev} to {revnumber}

The quickstart provides an upgrade script `upgrade.sh` for taking care of possible actions such as recreating some volume, executing some database specific updates,...

In order to upgrade to the latest version, you need to follow these steps:

1. `cd quickstart`
2. `git checkout master`
3. `git pull`
4. `./scripts/install.sh`
