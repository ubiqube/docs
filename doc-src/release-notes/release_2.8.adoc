The focus of the 2.8.0 release of {product_name} is mainly about improving the performances and reliability. 

The Microservice console has also been improved to provide a better user experience by allowing bulk changes of the microservice instances as well as additional design features. Advanced parameters have also been improved for a better support of the variables.

== Microservices

=== Duplicate an instance

Now you can select a instance of a microservice and duplicate it, you will see the same screen as "Add Row", but the difference is that the values are pre-filled.

=== Read: generate a custom preview of your configuration

You can now implement the "Read" function of a microservice with a Smarty PHP template and use the new "Read" button to generate a preview of the microservice instance as stored in the database.

This can be useful to generate a preview of the configuration to push to the managed entity. 

Just like the other microservice functions such as Create, Update and Delete, the Read is implemented as a template. This gives you the possibility to generate any format like simple key/value, JSON, XML,...

=== Bulk operation

Microservice bulk operations allow you create/update and delete several instance of a microservice.

With "Primary Composite Key", the new variable advanced parameter, you can bulk create microservice and specify unique values for the variables.

=== Split view

Use the microservice console horizontal split view to display and work on the instances of 2 microservices.
