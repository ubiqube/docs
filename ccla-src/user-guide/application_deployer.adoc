Cloudclapp offer large possibility of applications deployment: container based or VM based

== Marketplaces ==

Cloudclapp's marketplaces provide users to access large software applications and services that are built on, integrate with or complement the cloud provider's offerings.

=== Public Docker Hub ===

Docker Hub is the world's largest repository of container images with an array of content sources including container community developers, open source projects and independent software vendors (ISV) building and distributing their code in containers.

=== Private Docker Hub ===

Private Docker repositories provide restricted access to the images that they contain. Unlike public repositories, only authorized users can access the images. This way, it's possible to allow access only to a specific group of users, like organizations, teams, or even a single person.

=== Manifest APP ===

To permit a large variety of applications to be deployed, Manifest APP tab permit to import applications, from Github repository. 3 types of applications are supported.

* Terraform application
* K8/YML application
* HelmChart application

To be recognized by Cloudclapp, and permit parameters substitution, those applications must respect some conventions. The name of application is the name of the root folder under Github repository.
Depending the type of the application, those files must be present to permit parameters substitution and adapt the deployment.

* terraform.tfvars for TF application
* configmap.yaml for K8/YML application
* values.yaml for HelmChart application

==== TF application - terraform.tfvars ====

== Deploy application ==

Deploying application could be done in differents ways:

* Using blueprints from marketplaces or created by users from the organization
* Using a quick deployment

== Quick Deployment

To create a new deployment, select an environment and click on the plus button.

image:env_builder/add_deployment.png[900]     

Add application images and define ports and node ports with proper deployment name.

See the estimation right before your deployment that you can change Hourly, Monthly or Annual.

== Deployment view ==


The *Dashboard* displays various informations about the deployment. It can be personalized as explained in xref:navigation_dashboard.adoc[Navigation and Dashboard settings].

The *Operate* section is divided in different tabs:

* *Application:* Displays deployment informations. Provides buttons to Migrate, Tear Down or pause and resume the deployment.

* *Security:* Provide a security dashboard about this deployment, with Web App Scan and Image Scan functions. You can refer to the xref:security.adoc[Security section] of the documentation.

* *Automations:* Displays a history of every automations that has been performed on the deployment.
