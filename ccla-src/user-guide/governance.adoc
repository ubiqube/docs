== Approval requests ==

In order to control ressources creation over cloud platforms, approval request force a user to do in 2 steps the infrastructure creation

Using permission profile, an administrator of an organization can assign some "approval" rights to a user 

If a user is restricted by "Create With Approval" right, environement creation will be conditionned to approval of the administrator of the organization

In the environement dashboard, a user can see a "Waiting" status, meaning an approval is required to finalize the creation process

image:governance/SendApproval.png[alt=Governance Menu, width=900px,align="center"]

Once the request is send, administraor is notified by mail. He is invited to review this request inside Cloudclapp > Governance > Approvals

image:governance/ApprovalMail.png[alt=Governance Menu, width=900px,align="center"]

In the approval screen, an administraor can review requests, and decide to approve or decline a request using icons on the right

image:governance/ApprovalsTab.png[alt=Governance Menu, width=900px,align="center"]

If approved, a user can see "Approved" in environement screen and then clicking on "Deploy". A notification is also send by mail to confirm the approval

== Audit Logs ==

To track user activity, use audit logs
