== Approval requests ==

In order to control ressources creation over cloud platforms, approval request force a user to do in 2 steps the infrastructure creation

Using permission profile, an administrator of an organization can assign some "approval" rights to a user 

If a user is restricted by "Create With Approval" right, environement creation will be conditionned to approval of the administrator of the organization

In the environement dashboard, a user can see a "Waiting" status, meaning an approval is required to finalize the creation process

image:governance/SendApproval.png[alt=Governance Menu, width=900px,align="center"]

Once the request is send, administraor is notified by mail. He is invited to review this request inside Cloudclapp > Governance > Approvals

image:governance/ApprovalMail.png[alt=Governance Menu, width=900px,align="center"]

In the approval screen, an administraor can review requests, and decide to approve or decline a request using icons on the right

image:governance/ApprovalsTab.png[alt=Governance Menu, width=900px,align="center"]

If approved, a user can see "Approved" in environement screen and then clicking on "Deploy". A notification is also send by mail to confirm the approval

== Audit Logs ==

To track user activity, use audit logs.

image:governance/audit_logs.png[alt=Governance Menu, width=600px,align="center"]

== Quota check before deployment (Azure) ==

To check quota before creating a new ressources, a new control has been added to avoid issues during deployment

For any ressources planned to be deployed in Azure, the platform, based on provider account will check capacity

image:governance/quota_check_azure.png[alt=Governance Menu, width=600px,align="center"]

If quota issue is detected, such message will be displayed. The user will be invited to increase quotas or choose a different region

----
Quota limit exceeded for region (vCPU) : AZURE - Central India 

Current regional limit : 10
Current regional usage : 8
New additional instances required : 4
New regional limit required : 12

Increase regional vCPU quotas or use a different region
Please read more about quota limits at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-supportability/regional-quota-requests
----
NOTE: The quota check per provider is controlled via the SDK and can be disabled. Only Azure is supported in MVP3. Plz see integration page
