Cloudclapp has some built-in security mechanisms that enable secure and resilient deployments across all cloud providers

= Cloud Credentials in Vault =

Access Keys are one of the most important things to safeguard in order to prevent access to your cloud accounts. Cloudclapp requires these credentials in order to create your cloud infrastructure on your behalf and manage the created resources

In cloudclapp all of the access keys and credentials are encrypted by default and stored in secure manner using https://www.vaultproject.io/[Hashicorp Vault]

HashiCorp Vault is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. Vault provides encryption services that are gated by authentication and authorization methods.

= Image Scan =

Cloudclapp includes an optional feature that allows you to scan any docker image that is deployed using CCLA for vulnerabilities and also gives you a quick overview of the results across four severities - CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW

It is also possible to download the results as a JSON file for further analysis and remediation.

= Web App Scan =

Cloudclapp also allows a user to specify any web application via a URL and then runs common security checks against that URL to ensure that the Webapp is safe from any vulnerabilities

It is also possible to download the results as a JSON file for further analysis and remediation.
