== Blueprints ==

The catalog view

=== OpenMSA Library ===

Blueprint catalog offers a large possibility of deployments

image:blueprints/catalog.png[600]

* Wordpress on Azure
* Multi Regions on Azure
* Hybrid cloud mixing a local installation of MSActivator and an external monitoring system
* Multi cloud with distributed Redis Databases for High availability and scalability
* Private 5G with CNF deploy on the edge

Blueprints exist with the demo flag, a green capsule inside the preview. Demo flag means no real resources are consumed on CSPs. Those blueprints permit to demonstrate orchestration framework and associated features.
Data are simulated in this mode for different features (configure, compliance, monitoring...)

=== Editor ===

==== Library ====

Drag & Drop components from Library. Library are provided for per cloud providers

* Provider: an element representing a public or private cloud platform

* Region / Zone: supported regions inside a provider. Not supported for VMware or Kubernetes

* K8 cluster: a element representing one Kubernetes cluster

* Mesh: an element allowing to interconnect 2 clouds. This element should be placed after the APP

* Workflow: an element allowing to execute any {product_name} Workflow at any place in the designer

* App deployment: deploy an application from any marketplace or repository

image:providers/BPEditor.png[900]

==== Graphical options ====

* Hand tool

* Lasso tool

* Space tool

* Connect tool

==== Design operations ====

* Save design: Edit the Blueprint design and save this design

== New Environment
An environment can also be created without Blueprint, using _Add New Environment_ button on the Operate tab within organization view.

== The wizard ==

=== Native K8 import ===

image:providers/Kubernetes.png[800]

4 fields are needed to import an existing K8 platform in {ccla_product_name}

* **API Server IP/Host**: This value is usually the IP address of the Master Node in the Kubernetes cluster

* **API Server Port** :The API server is generally exposed on the port 6443 by default. {ccla_product_name} will check if the specific port on the given IP is reachable before Import. In a kubeconfig file, both of the above values are in the server field for a cluster

* **Certificate Authority Data** : Certificate generated 

* **Kubernetes Service Account Token**: Token associated with a service account. This service account can then be bound to a cluster role to provide granular access across the K8s cluster.

image:providers/Kubernetes_Connection.png[900]

NOTE: Check the appendix below to have more details to how retrieve those informations

== Designer ==

Same as the blueprint editor, a user can modify a design before to deploy it. In addition, 2 operations are available for saving the design.

* *Save environment as Blueprint:* Once the design is saved, it can be used as a Environment.

* *Deploy:* Click on Deploy to complete the deployment of the apps over K8 cluster that is selected

== Environment view ==

The *Dashboard* displays various informations about the entire environment. It can be personalized as explained in xref:navigation_dashboard.adoc[Navigation and Dashboard settings].

The *Operate* section is divided in different tabs:

* *Design (optional):* This tab only appears when the environment has been created from a Blueprint. It shows design and history of deployment status and every workflow executions.

* *Deployments:* Displays a list of the environments and its deployments with additional informations like status and configurations.

* *Compliance:* Gives an overview of environment security, refers to xref:security.adoc[Environment Compliance Overview] for more details.

* *FinOps:* Displays environment cost by providers. _You can refer to_ xref:cost_management.adoc[_Cost management page._]

* *Monitor:* Provides environment monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana (details, below in Monitoring section).

* *Mesh:* Using Istio, monitors metrics about interconnections of clouds and applications.

* *Configure:* Shows VM configurations.

* *Automations:* Lists all BPM on the left and every automation instances on the right, as an history.

=== Monitoring ===

Monitoring is done with the help of Prometheus and Grafana. It is deployed as individual deployments and services in the K8s cluster using YAML manifests available here https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus. These manifests create the necessary deployments, service accounts and roles required for deploying Prometheus, Grafana and Alert Manager. 

To display the dashboards of these services, we create a service of type load balancer and use the native Load Balancers provided by the cloud providers.

_Note: Enabling monitoring will deploy additional pods and services along with load balancers for Prometheus and Grafana. Hence this will affect the cost incurred when creating the cluster._

== Details of WF steps ==

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Steps|Description

|Create TF Workspace
|

Create a workspace folder and copy the template terraform files to the newly created workspace. This workspace will be the working directory for Terraform

|Set TF variables values
|

Read the input data given by the user and replace the appropriate values in the terraform files

|Initialize TF Workspace
|

Runs `+terraform init+` command in the workspace

|Provision cluster
|

Runs `+terraform plan+` command followed by a `+terraform apply+` which will provision the resources

|Create Cluster Managed Entity
|

Create a virtual Managed Entity for the newly created cluster in MSActivator that will be used to manage the cluster with the help of MicroServices

|Deploy Prometheus and Grafana
|

Optional step to deploy the Prometheus and Grafana stack on the created cluster that will enable CCLA to show monitoring data

|Trigger compliance scan
|

Runs the Compliance Scan Workflow which will deploy a Job to run kubebench on the cluster and fetch the scan results

|===

== Appendix ==
=== K8 service token and certificate ===

In order to access the K8s APIs, CCLA requires a token associated with a service account. 
This service account can then be bound to a cluster role to provide granular access across the K8s cluster.

Create YAML files for serviceaccount, clusterrole and clusterrolebinding

Use kubectl to apply these resources

kubectl apply -f serviceaccount.yaml
kubectl apply -f clusterrole.yaml

Now create a secret that will hold the token for the service account

kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
----
The above secret should contain the CA data and Token required as inputs for CCLA. To get the values from the secret, run kubectl get secret ccla-token -oyaml
This command will display the data stored in YAML format.
