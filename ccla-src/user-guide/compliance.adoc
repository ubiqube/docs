When managing infrastructures for production use cases, security and compliance are crucial factors to consider. The clusters need to be securely configured to minimize the attack surface. Additionally, every organization might have audit requirements for systems to be compliant with security standards.

{ccla_product_name} enables you to stay compliant with more than 10 regulations such as HIPAA, CIS, PCI-DSS or ISO. Using our compliance module, you can identify any non-compliant resources in your environments.

_Note : In {ccla_product_name} V2.X, compliance is applied only to Kubernetes environment_

_Note : Public providers lock access to manager nodes. The compliance process will be applied only to workers nodes_

== Compliance for Environment

As the reference for our compliance module, the Center for Internet Security or CIS is the entry point for our compliance scan (https://www.cisecurity.org/).
We have reuse the concept of Implementation Groups (IG) to drive how deep an environment is affected by the compliance needs.
We assume, depending on the type of your environment, the level of compliance, so the associated security rules are not same if you deploy a local sandbox, a pre-production or a production platform.

=== Sensitive / IG mapping

Per environment, by clicking on the gear icon, it's possible to select between 4 levels to apply the compliance, and one or more standard. The sensitive will drive the number of tests

* *No data protection* : no compliance applied
* *Basic* : controls for small, commercial off-the-shelf or home office software environments where sensitivity of the data is low. Minimal standard of information security
* *Extended* : controls focused on helping security teams manage sensitive client
* *Expert* : controls that reduce the impact of zero-day attacks and targeted attacks from sophisticated adversaries.

=== Dashboard

From environment home page, a user can access compliance dashboard by clicking on *Compliance*

Depending on standards selected in environment settings, each row represents percentage of completion of standards with 3 colors 

* PASS / Green : indicates that the test was run successfully, and passed

* FAIL / Red : indicates that the test was run successfully, and failed

* WARN / Amber : means this test needs further attention, for example it is a test that needs to be run manually

=== Remediation

After running a compliance scan, for each standards, a JSON report is available in the dashboard. Click in the arrow to download it

Inside, results are presented by status : pass, fail and warning.

The first number in the JSON represents the CIS reference

----
    "CSA": {
        "PASS": {
            "3.3": {
                "DSP-17": "Sensitive Data Protection - Define and implement, processes, procedures and technical measures to protect sensitive data throughout it's lifecycle.",
                "IAM-05": "Least Privilege - Employ the least privilege principle when implementing information system access."
            },
            "total": 1
        },
        "FAIL": {
            "3.10": {
                "CEK-03": "Data Encryption - Provide cryptographic protection to data at-rest and in-transit, using cryptographic libraries certified to approved standards.",
            },
            "6.2": {
                "HRS-06": "Employment Termination - Establish, document, and communicate to all personnel the procedures outlining the roles and responsibilities concerning changes in employment.",
                "IAM-01": "Identity and Access Management Policy and Procedures - Establish, document, approve, communicate, implement, apply, evaluate and maintain policies and procedures for identity and access management. Review and update the policies and procedures at least annually."
            }
            "total": 2
        }
		...
    }
----

_Note : In the previous extract, 2 tests in failure are *3.10* and *6.2* for *CIS* standard matching CEK-03,HRS-06,IAM-01 for *CSA* standard_

Depending to the type of K8 cluster, a CIS benchmarks report can be downloaded to find details of test and remediation mechanism

* EKS cluster : CIS_Amazon_Elastic_Kubernetes_Service_(EKS)_Benchmark_v1.2.0.pdf
* AKS cluster : CIS_Azure_Kubernetes_Service_(AKS)_Benchmark_v1.2.0.pdf
* GKE cluster : CIS_Google_Kubernetes_Engine_(GKE)_Benchmark_v1.2.0.pdf
* Kubernetes cluster : CIS_Kubernetes_Benchmark_v1.6.0.pdf

Use the PDF report in the dashboard to find this reference and the associated remediation process

=== Backend

As many of automation task in {ccla_product_name}, compliance scan is implemented via a workflow
This workflow is composed of 3 processes :

* Launch scan
* Re-scan
* Delete scan

==== Kube Bench integration

Kube-bench is an open-source tool to assess the security of Kubernetes clusters by running checks against the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Kubernetes benchmark. It was developed in GoLang by Aqua Security, a provider of cloud-native security solutions.

Kube-bench can help with the following.

* Cluster hardening: Kube-bench automates the process of checking the cluster configuration as per the security guidelines outlined in CIS benchmarks
* Policy Enforcement: Kube-bech checks for RBAC configuration to ensure the necessary least privileges are applied to service accounts, users, etc. it also checks for pod security standards and secret management
* Network segmentation: Kube-bench checks for CNI and its support for network policy to ensure that network policies are defined for all namespaces
