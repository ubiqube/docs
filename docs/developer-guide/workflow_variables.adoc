Variables are usually used to hold the parameters to be passed to a workflow process. For instance, the port and IP address variables to block for a firewall policy. Variables can also be used to display user information that is not meant to be used for any actuall configuration.

Setting variables is done from the section "Variables" on the workflow editor screen.

image:workflow_console_variables.png[width=700px]

All variables are referenced with the prefix `$params` which is automatically set in the variable editor screen and when a variable has to be referenced in one of the workflow functions, you need to use the syntax `{$params.your_variable}` (see below for more examples).

By default the type of a variable is String but other types are supported such as Integer, Boolean, Password, IpAddress, ObjectRef,...

== Overview

The variables are usually defined to hold the parameters to be passed to the workflow. For instance, the port and IP address to block for a firewall policy. Variables can also be used to display user information that is not necessarily meant to be used for configuring the managed entity.

Setting different types for variables will affect the way the workflow end user form, for creating or updating it, will render.

For instance, the type boolean will render the variable with true/false radio buttons.

== Defaut settings

When creating or editing a variable, there are some information that need to be provided in the "Default" section.

=== Variable

Name of the variable to use in the implementation of the workflow or when calling the REST API.

=== Type

The type of the variable should be one from the list below

==== String

The default type for a variable, it will accepts any value and the UI renders it as a input field without any specifc validation with regards to the value set.

==== Boolean

This data type accepts a value of true or false, the UI will render it as a checkbox.

==== Integer

This data type represents a numerical value, the UI will render it as an input field restricted to integer.

==== Password
NOTE: not supported yet

This data type represents a multicharacter value that is hidden from plain sight (i.e. the value is represented as asterisks instead of clear text). 

==== IPv4 address and mask, IPv6 mask
NOTE: not supported yet

This data type will enforce data validation against IP address formats.

==== Composite
NOTE: not supported yet

The variable type composite provide ways to add control over the behaviour of the workflow user form.

It can be used, for instance, to show/hide parts of the form based on the value of another component of the form.

==== Link
NOTE: not supported yet

This type is useful if you wat to display a URL in the user form, for instance to link to some documentation on a web server. It is usually used in read-only mode with the URL set as the default value of the variable

==== File
NOTE: not supported yet

This type is useful for allowing a user to select a file.

==== Auto Increment

This type is used to maintain an incremental counter in within the instances of a workflow for a managed entity. This is useful for managing the object_id.

.Specific advanced parameters
|===
| Increment                                 | an integer to define the increment step
| Start Increment                           | the initial value for the variable
| Workflows sharing the same increment  | a list of workflows that are also using the same variable and need to share a common value.

==== Device 

This type is used to allow the user to select a managed entity and pass its identifier to the implementation of the workflow.

In the task implementation you need to list the variables with "Device" for the type

.PHP
[source, php]
----
function list_args()
{
  create_var_def('my_device');
}
----

.Python
[source, python]
----
from msa_sdk.variables import Variables

TaskVariables = Variables()

TaskVariables.add('my_device')
----

===== List of managed entities

A very common use of the type `Device` is for automating configuration (or any other automated action) over a list of managed entities.

You can do that by creating a array variable with the type `Device` and loop through the array in the task.

.Sample task to list managed entities (Python)
[source, python]
----
from msa_sdk.variables import Variables
from msa_sdk.msa_api import MSA_API
from msa_sdk import util

dev_var = Variables()
dev_var.add('me_list.0.id')                                       <1>

context = Variables.task_call(dev_var)
process_id = context['SERVICEINSTANCEID']                         <2>

me_list = context['me_list']                                      <3>

for me_id in me_list:                                             <4>
    util.log_to_process_file(process_id, me_id['id'])             <5>    

ret = MSA_API.process_content('ENDED', 'Task OK', context, True)
print(ret)
----
<1> declare the the array variable to be displayed in UI
<2> read the current process ID
<3> read the list of managed entities selected by the user on the UI
<4> loop through the list and print each managed entity ID in the process log file
<5> print the managed entity identifier in the process log file

.Sample code to list managed entities (PHP)
[source, php]
----
function list_args()
{
  create_var_def('devices.0.id');
}

// read the ID of the selected managed entity  
$devices = $context['devices'];

foreach ($devices as $device) {
  $device_id = $device['id'];

  logToFile("update device $device_id");
}
----

==== Customer (Subtenant)

This type will allow the user to select a subtenant and use the subtenant ID from the workflow instance context in the task.

The source code below will let the user select a subtenant and display the subtenant ID on the execution console

.Sample task to create a UI to select a subtenant
[source, php]
----
<?php
require_once '/opt/fmc_repository/Process/Reference/Common/common.php';

function list_args()
{
  create_var_def('subtenant');                <1>
}

$subtenant = $context['subtenant'];           <2>

task_success('Task OK: '.$subtenant);         <3>
?>
----
<1> declare the variable subtenant to be displayed in the user form
<2> read the variable value from the context
<3> print the value on the execution console

image:workflow_console_variables_customer.png[width=700px]

===== List of subtenant

If you need to select multiple subtenants, you have to create an array variable with the type `Customer`.

With the variable `$params.subtenants.0.id` typed as `Customer`, the code below will ask for the user to select 1 or more subtenant, print the identifier of each one in the link:workflow_editor{outfilesuffix}#logging[process log file] and display the number of subtenant selected on the UI.

.Sample task to list the subtenant
[source, php]
----
<?php
require_once '/opt/fmc_repository/Process/Reference/Common/common.php';

function list_args()
{
  create_var_def('subtenants.0.id');
}

$subtenants = $context['subtenants'];

foreach ($subtenants as $subtenant) {           <1>
  logToFile("subtenant: ".$subtenant['id']);    <2>
}

task_success('Task OK: '.sizeof($subtenants )." subtenant selected");
?>
----
<1> loop through the list of subtenants
<2> log the value in the process log file

TIP: the code for iterating over an array of managed entities is very similar 

==== Microservice reference

This type is the key when integrating workflows and microservices, it will allow you to use the data imported by the microservice from a managed entity in your automation code.

To use this type you need 2 variables:
1. a variable with the type `Device` to select the managed entity to get the data from
2. a variable with the type `Microservice Reference` to select the microservice that will pull the data

When creating a variable typed `Microservice Reference` you need to select the `Device` variable and the microservice.

In the exmaple below, the variable `$params.user` is typed as `Microservice Reference`. In the "Advanced" tab, the field "Microservice Reference" references one or several microservice and the field "Device ID" references a managed entity.

.Sample PHP task to create the UI to select a managed entity and select a microservice instance from this managed entity
[source, PHP]
----
<?php

require_once '/opt/fmc_repository/Process/Reference/Common/common.php';

function list_args()
{
  create_var_def('me');
  create_var_def('user');
}

task_success('Task OK');
?>
----

It also possible to use an array to select multiple values from the microservice

{
  create_var_def('me');
  create_var_def('users.0.user');
}

task_success('Task OK');
?>

==== Service reference (workflow reference)
NOTE: not supported yet

This type is useful for referencing a workflow from another one.

=== Display Name

The display value for the variable name.

=== Description

An optional description of this variable.

== Advanced settings

Depending on the selected type, some advanced parameters may be differ.

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===

| Setting                   | Description
| Default Value             | the default value that will be used when creating a new workflow instance
| Values for Drop-down      | a list of possible value the user can choose from
| Mandatory                 | a value has to be provided for this variable
| Read only variable        | the value cannot be edited
| Section Header            | group some variables in the link:../user-guide/workflows{outfilesuffix}#workflow-console[workflow console] (see link:#group_variables[below]).
| Show only in edit view    | hide the variable from the link:../user-guide/workflows{outfilesuffix}#workflow-console[workflow console]
|===

=== Array settings

When you are dealing with variable arrays, these options will let you control the possible actions a user can have over the array.

== Variable arrays

To create a variable array, you need to follow a precise naming convention: `$params.<ARRAY NAME>.0.<ELEMENT NAME>`. The 0, is the separator that will allow the UI and the configuration engine that this variable is an array.
