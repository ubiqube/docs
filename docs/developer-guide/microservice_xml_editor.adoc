== Overview

XML microservice are used to manage entities that expose a REST API.

To create a XML microservice, you need to check XML for the configuration type when creating a new microservice

NOTE: do not try to change the configuration type of an existing microservice as this is not supported.

=== The functions Create, Update and Delete

==== Create and Update
These functions will call the REST API design to create or update the managed entity configuration.

For instance, the REST API to create a new tenant is

*HTTP Request:* `+/operator/{$prefix}+`

*Method:* `+POST+`
[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
| Parameter Name
| Type
| Description

| name
| String
| the name of the tenant
|===

*Example:*
[source]
----
POST /api/tenancy/tenants/
----

In case you need to pass in a JSON payload with the parameters, the microservice Create will look like this.

==== Import

The main difference between the CLI and REST (Json/XML) Microservice definition is the implementation of the functions Create/Update/...

CLI Microservice definition is covered in this documentation: link:microservice_cli_editor{outfilesuffix}[CLI microservice editor].

This documentation uses the link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adaptors/tree/master/adapters/rest_netbox[Netbox REST adapter] and the link:https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rest-api/overview/[Netbox] REST API to illustrate the design of XML Microservice.
