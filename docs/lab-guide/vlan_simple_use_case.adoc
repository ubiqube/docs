== Overview

This lab guide will show you how to create layer2-switches or a routers out of a bare Linux machine.

== Architecture

Let's start from VLAN definition:

A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN] broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network.

Linux bridge perfectly fits this requirement.

Let's do it in the next way: one broadcast domain - one bridge.

== Sandbox environment

To make a lightweight playground topology we are using Docker containers, simple and cross-platform.

=== Switch

we need these packages on the top of basic OS (Alpine):

- openssh (to take control over the SWITCH)
- bash (to make some stdout parsing)
- tcpdump (to capture/verify tagged traffic)

Docker image is 14.4MB (alpine:3.12).

=== Hosts

we need several hosts connected to the SWITCH to test different VLAN scenarios.

- pc_01, pc_02 -  placed in default_vlan, traffic from hosts untagged.
- pc_03 - placed in 100 vlan, traffic from host untagged.
- pc_04 - placed in 200 vlan, traffic from host tagged.

.required packages:
openssh (to take control over)

== Scenarios

1. Default state:

- pc_01, pc_02 - can ping each other, placed in default_vlan
- pc_03 is not reachable, placed in 100 vlan
- pc_03 is not reachable, placed in 200 vlan, encapsulates frames with 200 802.1q tag.

2. Set pc_01 in vlan 100 and ping pc_03

3. Set pc_01 in vlan 200(untagged) and ping pc_04

- ensure with TCP dump packets are encapsulated/de-encapsulated properly

4. Set pc_01 in vlan 200(tagged) and ping pc04

NOTE: pc_01 should have tagging enabled

=== Dockerfile and docker-compose files

=== Workarounds

.pc.sh
Workaround to assing certain network addresses to interfaces randomized by docker.

consider "eht0" interface one that have 172.20.0.x address assigned by Docker DHCP.

consider "eht1" interface one that have 10.222.x.y address assigned by Docker DHCP.

[source, shell]
----
# WORKAROUND FOR UNCERTAIN DOCKER INTERFACE ORDER
eth0=$(ifconfig | grep -B1 "inet addr:172.20.0." | awk '$1!="inet" && $1!="--" {print $1}')
eth1=$(ifconfig | grep -B1 "inet addr:10.222." | awk '$1!="inet" && $1!="--" {print $1}')
----

[source, shell]
----
# CHANGE IP ADDRESS TO THE PROPER ONE AND MAKE 4th MACHINE TAGGED
NUM=`echo $HOSTNAME | grep -E -o '[1-9]'`
IPADDR=`ifconfig $eth1 | grep 'inet addr' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{print $1}'`
NEW_IPADDR='10.222.222.1'$NUM'/24'
----

NOTE: complete pc.sh - available link:https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart/blob/master/lab/vlan/pc.sh[here]


For PC_04 here is 802.1q tagging enabling, for PC_01,PC_02,PC_03 - untagged:

[source, shell]
----
if [ $NUM = '4' ]; then
    ip a d $IPADDR dev $eth1
    ip link add link $eth1 name $eth1.200 type vlan id 200
    ip a a $NEW_IPADDR dev $eth1.200
    iplink set $eth1.200 up
else
    ip a d $IPADDR dev $eth1
    ip a a $NEW_IPADDR dev $eth1
fi
----

.switch.sh

Assigns certain network addresses to interfaces randomized by docker.

Creates tagged interface faced on PC_04.

Uses bridge-utils to create network broadcast domains (VLANs).

NOTE: complete switch.sh - available link:https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart/blob/master/lab/vlan/switch.sh[here]


So, at this step we are good to go and should be ready to start managing the switch.

== Framework

MSActivator is an Integrated Automation Platform (IAP) framework for creating user-friendly, easy, maintainable and scalable solutions...

=== Step 1: register the switch

=== Step 2: control the bridge

Then we need to think of how to control the bridge utils - microservices will help us much:

Here you can see representation of the next output

There are three interfaces which names starts with "vlan", so there is a naming convention I've chosen and I'm following, to retrieve and parse that data we just need to specify appropriate command and regexp - that is all!

According to CRUD/I model we can CREATE interface (bridge), DELETE or UPDATE, let's see how it works:

=== Step 3: CREATE

 image:vlan_simple_6.png[width=1000px]

=== Step 4: DELETE

 image:vlan_simple_7.png[width=1000px]

=== Step 5: UPDATE

 image:vlan_simple_8.png[width=1000px]

=== Step 6: use the UI

Finally we can see it works from UI.

 image:vlan_simple_9.png[width=1000px]

For example change VLAN 100 to DOWN state:

 image:vlan_simple_10.png[width=1000px]

=== Step 6: Now we can control the processes

- create bridge
- delete bridge
- enable bridge
- disable bridge

=== Step 7: control host-faced (end-user) network interfaces

Let's think how to control host-faced (end-user) network interfaces. 

I suggest creating one more microservice, these feature should be decoupled in order to be reused and simplified.

That is how I want to see it:

 image:vlan_simple_11.png[width=1000px]

And that is how it actually looks:

[source, shell]
----
switch:~# brctl show
bridge name             bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
vlan_200                8000.02420adee10a       no              eth3.200
vlan_100                8000.02420adee00a       no              eth2
vlan_default            8000.02420adede0a       no              eth0
                                                                eth1
                                                                eth3
----                                                                

==== CREATE

More complicated than first Microservice but still simple and much more flexible because it handles user input exceptions:

 image:vlan_simple_12.png[width=1000px]

All you need to do is just to list command as you are in CLI and replace certain values with variables

==== DELETE

 image:vlan_simple_13.png[width=1000px]
    
=== UPDATE
presumes several options:

- switch interface from one vlan to other: (untagged > untagged), (tagged > untagged), (tagged > untagged)
- option (tagged > tagged) handles by DELETE (or/and) CREATE method, You create one more bridge and assign port to it.

Finally here is an example from UI
